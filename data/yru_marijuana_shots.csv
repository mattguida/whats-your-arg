ma167,"I support legalizing marijuana, because those countries that have marijuana legal have less problems with schedule 1 drugs. What happens in the US is that those who do smoke marijuana get caught with it and get put on probation. While they are on probation that start using Schedule 1 drugs like Cocaine, which exits your system in no more than 72hrs. This is why marijuana is a gateway drug. For those who do not smoke marijuana, I don't think that making it legal would make much of a difference. Marijuana is like cigarettes being so easy to come by that if you wanted to smoke it you would go get you some. By legalizing marijuana maybe some of our tax money used to keep those in prison for having marijuana could go towards something better, like education.",p-right,What happens in the US is that those who do smoke marijuana get caught with it and get put on probation.,ma167arg0

ma201,"okay. so the only reason weed is illegal is because the freaking usa cant put a tax on it, it being to easy to grow. well tell me how that makes any since.. many people have vegetable gardens... yet vegies arent illegal and there easy grown as well. so that makes no since not to be able to tax weed. its a plant for crying out loud!!. it was out on earth for a reason to keep peace!. so smoke it up and spread the peace!. obama should legalize it! for one.. they need more money in the economy.. they would make a shit load if stores started selling weed and we would be out of recession, only everyone would be a pot head. so what if everyone was it would be normal right?.",p-legal,"they need more money in the economy.. they would make a shit load if stores started selling weed and we would be out of recession, only everyone would be a pot head.",ma201arg0

ma400,"Debaters debate the two wars as if Nixonâs civil war on Woodstock Nation did not yet run amok. The persecution of the half-a-million strong hippies assembled in August 1969 canât be good for America, the world-leader in percentile behind bars. Madam Secretary Clinton need not travel to Tibet to find a minority subculture stripped of human rights. If we are all about spreading liberty abroad, then why mix the message at home? Peace on the home front would enhance credibility.   Stop throwing good money after bad. The witch-hunt doctorâs Rx is for every bust to numerate a bigger tax-load over a smaller denominator of payers. Spend more on prisons than on schools. My shamanâs second opinion is homegrown herbal remedy. Consumer dollars can stimulate the economy better if they arenât depleted by prohibitionâs black market.  Only a clause about interstate commerce provides a shred of constitutionality. The commerce policy on the number-one cash crop in the land is no taxation; yes eradication. But money to frustrate enforcement grows on trees. Did the authors of the Constitution intend to divert the Treasuryâs natural revenue to Mexican cartels? America rejected prohibition, but its back. Swat teams donât seem to need no stinking amendment.  The demonized substances never had their day in court. Nixon promised to supply supporting evidence later. Later, the Commission evidence didnât support, but no matter. The witch-hunt was on. No amendments can assure due-process under an anti-science law that never had any due-process itself. Science hailed LSD as a drug with breakthrough potential, until the CSA (Controlled Substances Act of 1970) halted all research. Marijuana has no medical use, period. Lives are flushed down expensive tubes.  The RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993) allows Native American Church members to eat peyote. A specific church membership should not be prerequisite for Americans to obtain their birthright freedom of religion. Denial of entheogen sacrament to any American, for mediation of communion twixt the soul and the source of souls, violates the First Amendment.  Freedom of speech presupposes freedom of thought. The Constitution doesnât enumerate any governmental power to embargo diverse states of mind. How and when did government usurp this power to coerce conformity? Legislators who would limit cognitive liberty lack jurisdiction.  Common Law must hold that the people are the legal owners of their own bodies. Socrates says, know your self. Mortal law should not presume to thwart the intelligent design that molecular keys unlock spiritual doors. Those who appreciate their own free choice of personal path in life should not deny self-exploration to seekers. The right to the pursuit of happiness is supposed to be inalienable by government.  Simple majorities in each house could put repeal of the CSA on the presidentâs desk. The books have ample law on them without the CSA. Americans are already liable for damages when they screw-up. The usual caveats remain in effect. Strong medicine requires prescription. Employees can be fired for poor job performance. No harm, no foul; and no excuse, either. Replace the war on drugs with a frugal, constitutional, science-based drugs policy.",p-legal,Consumer dollars can stimulate the economy better if they arenât depleted by prohibitionâs black market.,ma400arg3
