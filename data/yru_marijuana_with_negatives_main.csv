Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern.

And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol.

ma129,"The argument you are putting forth goes against the principle that the country's population can be trusted to make their own decisions as long as no-one else is harmed. Marijuana has a track record of being the safest drug around, safer even then alcohol.  Furthermore, the argument that terrorist groups benefit from the marijuana trade is just a myth. Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves. That isn't even touching on the other benefits of legalisation, including freeing up space in the over-crowded prison system, providing an additional source of government income in the form of tax and freeing up police time to tackle violent crimes.",p-not_addictive,1,ma129arg0

He didn't start using pot because he wanted to be high. He started using it to fit in with a crowd of people. He was very susceptible to peer pressure. That's the reason he went on to other drugs. He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be ""friends"" with his dealer.

ma166,"When it comes to my point of view on the legalization of Marijuana I believe that there is no reason what so ever for it to remain illegal.  I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",p-not_addictive,0,ma166arg0

ma171,"In reality, Marijuana is just as bad as tobacco and alcohol, however, Marijuana is proven to be a gateway drug into crack cocaine, heroin, opium, etc. It is also proven that the typical marijuana user smokes until high, not until relaxed. When a person is high, he or she is not fully functional. Most daily alcohol drinkers do not drink to get drunk, they drink until they're relaxed, that is one reason alcohol is legal. Marijuana is unfiltered and will cause lung damage as well as tobacco, however tobacco does not affect how you function while marijuana does (as previously stated). Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. It has proven poorer performance on thinking tasks, slower motor skill speed, poor attention span, poor verbal memory, and planning ability. Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run. Though Marijuana has proven to help slow down medical issues, it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue. Same goes with prescription medicine. Most of them only slow down your issue, not get rid of it. The reason prescription medicines are legal is because your doctor needs to allow you to take it. I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",p-not_addictive,0,ma171arg0

Even with 3 weeks of abstinence of Marijuana, attention span is permanently affected but motor skills, planning ability, and thinking tasks have slightly increased but are still affected. With Marijuana use, the brain is working harder than it should causing stress, shorter life span, and a weaker body in the long run.

ma176,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier.

Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor.

You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",c-Other,0,ma176arg11

Drugs like meth can do things like that as well as heroine or cocaine but not marijuana. Jane can be considered a gateway drug and in a lot of cases jane is a lot less harmful that alcohol is to our bodies. Pot does not do anywhere near as much damage to those around us than what alcohol does, getting high is just like a boost for the day. I know students that are in the top of my sophomore class that smoke pot regularly and are within top 20 out of a 600 student class.  The only thing I see that could come out of legalizing weed would be that since Americans already spend their money on weed now why not tax the shit and bring the US gov some extra pocket change?",c-Other,0,ma219arg11

ma269,""" Smoking marijuana does not cause brain damage. Guess what does though. Alcohol which you think should be legal. ""  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)

Also driving high is not nearly as dangerous as you think. Incredibly less dangerous than driving drunk.   How dangerous did you think I thought it was? I wasn't saying it was equal. Just that we shouldn't add to a problem.    I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.   What failure? Like I said. I don't think that driving high and drunk are the same. But they are both bad. And will happen more if weed id legalized.     But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.   Well there's that common sense again. Some people are stupid. It should be illegal to drive if you are going on 3 days of no sleep. But thats hard to enforce. Laws against driving  high  on the other hand, is not as tricky to enforce.    Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.   Calm down.",c-Other,0,ma326arg11

ma35,"1. why does each side have hundreds of points, but there are not arguements?  2. I'm glad you brought up this subject.   In the history of mankind, prohibition of any substance that one puts into their own body has never worked.  Alcohol was no more or less popular during prohibition, than now. The only difference was that instead of States and the feds recieving tons of tax dollars, and the money from alcohol purchase going into the hands of legitimate businesses that employed citizens who contributed to society and paid taxes,  all the money was going to gangsters and thugs.  Well, the same thing is going on now. Marijuana was not made illegal until 1937. Before then the plant was taxed. It employed people. Now it is not taxed, and those who sell it are usually criminals of some sort (though many are harmless)  Still, the amount of marijuana consumed has not diminished one bit.  Cannabis has been used all through recorded history.   link    What makes us think that now, in the last 72 years something about the plant has changed.  Marijuana's illegal status is a historical farce. It's laughable, pointless, and counter productive.  1. Marijuana is a better pain killer, with less harmful side effects than any perscription drug. It costs less (0 if you have dirt and water already) and it's less addictive.  Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene.   2. Taxes collected from the sale of marijuana would be in the hundreds of millions, it would give our economy an enourmous boost and employ potentially hundreds of thousands of people.  3. It would take the money from illegal drugs  out of  the hands of criminals.  4. It would be a huge relief on our overcrowded prisons, saving States hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, even millions in States with large prison populations like CA. Also, it would save the 18 year old A student and college hopeful from losing all his scholarships and having to check  YES  on every application that asks if they've ever been arrested, for the rest of his or her life, just because they had a tiny amount of a plant that is far safer than alcohol.  and by all means, come visit my blog sometime, www.crazydrugnews.blogspot.com.",p-not_addictive,1,ma35arg0

ma381,"Regarding your first two points, I agree, but your point is irrelevant. Yes people do break the rules, and if they do they will be punished. We have laws against playing music too loud, but because people do it anyway, should we make playing music illegal?

The point of that quote is that Mary Jane really isn't a drug as we would categorize it. In fact, it's more a food then a drug. A drug is a substance, usually man made at the end of the processing, which is not intended for dietary consumption.  Marijuana gets you high  just  if you smoke it from the plant stage. You don't have to add a bunch of chemicals and shit like with all other 'drugs' suchs as cigarettes and meth.   And with said, marijuana is also not addictive, unlike other drugs.  Marijuana is mentally addicted, yes... but so is  ice cream . Do make ice cream illegal for all the fat people it's created? No.  Mary Jane should be legal. Cigarettes and alcohol should be banned.

Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat.
