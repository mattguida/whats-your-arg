2arg7,"In answer to It is wrong to create fatherless or motherless families by design. Same-sex marriages have more to do with the desires of adults than the needs of children. Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households..Bologna!!There is no solid evidence saying that gay couples put children in an unstable environment children need love and acceptance it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is if you are capable of being responsible and compassionate- there are many good married Christian parents who abuse and shame their children- Children need positive role models not intolerance and a morality that picks and chooses what's right and wrong, and translates the bible to suit their own agenda.As for Ann Landers comment that gay marriage 'flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries. And that's where I must draw the line. Sorry.- Obviously the first few thousand years of existence when people lived without marriage and in poly-amorous extended families, with different spiritual beliefs is not a part of history she cares to learn about Christianity was not the first religion and God is way too big to fit into such a limited un-inclusive belief system",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
3arg5,"There is a mixed up message in culture today thinking the church is invading in political issues and that it has to do with our constitutional rights.

Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore man to all of his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties. It means the government should not butt in with the business of God and the church. A True Marriage is between God, man, and woman.

39arg5,"God invented marriage.  The concept of wife is first shown in Genesis 2:24:  Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. Therefore to say man to man and woman to woman is marriage is to redefine what God defined which makes it wrong. Other reason include: man to man sex is dangerous (AIDS), lower tax income due to more taking the marriage deduction, confused children not knowing who is mom or dad, cruel homophobic behavior (I don't condone) and last but not least, God speaks against woman to woman sex in Romans 1:26-27 and man to man in Leviticus 18:22.  Therefore if the leader says yes to what God has said NO to, this is indeed a slippery slope.  I want God to bless America.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,5

45arg6,Homosexuals can bring children into the world naturally and biologicaly . Conservatives think that a homosexual can't have sex with a woman and that is why homosexuals can't have children. The truth is that there's two methods how to bring children naturally into the world . It's calles petting and has the same quality  like sex. No one needs to have sex to bring children into the world. A homosexual will find a homosexual woman and both can bring a children into the world. the family is gonna be big because the homosexuals also live together with their same sex partners . Means that all live together in one house with the children that is naturally born by homosexuals . It has a lot of Pro's for the child. Also millions of bisexuals bring children into the world and also have sexual contact to same sex partners . Not only heterosexuals bring children into the world naturally. When a man and a woman have  achild so it does not mean that it has something to do that there's heterosexual . Reproduction has nothing to do with love . If u like someone you can also make achild with the one . If the there's no one around and only a homosexual man and woman and they don't love each other then both will make children to continue humanity,"Marriage is about more than procreation, therefore gay couples should not be denied the right to marry due to their biology.",5

58arg7,"I believe homosexuality is a perversion of a natural/original creation. The question is why?  I believe  lack of spirituality, hormonal influences and mutations are responsible for the original outcoming. Women no longer can find a good man to take his responsibilities as husband and father, and since women no longer need a man for financial support they are given up on looking for Mr. Right.  Men on the other hand , are more guilty in crime, as they have abandonned their purpose in order to follow lustful ways, just attend a gay pride parade and you know what I 'm talking about. I don't like what is being imposed on us by this gay movement. I believe all sexuality should be discrete, and yet they allow themselves to force their views and way of life trying to make it mainstream.

74arg4,I think that gay marriage should be allowed in every part of the world. If two people love eachother and want to be together forever then that should be it. Let them do it. The saying Love Is Love should be used. In the religious aspect of everything God says in the Bible that you should love everyone and treat them with kindness and compassion. So people who discriminate against the same sex wanting to be together are not Christians or do not believe in God. Places where they have same sex marriage banned are going to have chaos if they dont legalize it soon. I strongly believe that if two people love eachother then let them do what they want. If any oppurtuity comes up where love is shown then it's just making the world a more loving place.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5

Statistics show the divorce rate dropped 21% between the years 2003 and 2008, giving it the lowest divorce rate in the country. No evidence is given to support the fact that the legalization of gay marriage has ever been recorded to have had a negative effect on this aspect of the institution.   The con also gives statistics regarding the percentage of children born to unwed mothers. It does not, upon shallow  inspection, seem likely that the legalization of gay marriage would affect these numbers, for obvious reasons.  In short, this arguement is a fallacy.

You don't choose to be gay, but no one spitefully causes you to be gay either. Love knows no bounds. It can't hear, speak, touch, smell, or taste. It doesn't discriminate like many of our own kind. Keep in mind that I'm heterosexual. I love women and their bodies. If I can say that, and then tell you that hating on gays and their right to be married is wrong, then maybe it will open your eyes and your minds a little more.As for people who argue that gay marriage will destroy the boundaries between state and religion, that boundary shouln't even exist.

113arg7,"Marriage:Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. If this were to be looked at as a gay marriage situation, the only thing that would really upset me is the 'found a family' part. It angers me how everyone is putting words into the mouths of kids by saying Oh they'll be fine or It won't effect. Do you even know how it feels?! My mom 'turned lesbian' about two years after my parents divorced. I was about 15 years old. Since she wanted to live up to her selfish ways of being a 'guy trapped in a woman's body' I had no one to guide me through my teenage years of being a girl. I had to figure everything out on my own and aside from that, live with the fear of people finding out who my mom was. The few people that did find out began bullying me. Now my little 11 year old sister is going through the same hell. For all you blind people, I WASN'T FINE, I WAS SUICIDAL. The only thing that stopped me was the idea of my sister hanging from that cord after me",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4
114arg7,"My disagreement lies more with the argument for altering the existing union of male/female marriage, which is based on a falacy that homosexuals are somehow legally restricted in their right to engage in marriage, as defined between man and woman. In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples. Sexual orientation is not currently and should never be a factor in legal unions for same sex or opposite sex couples.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,5

The prime example is that they would receive a reduction of their Federal, and probably State, income taxes if allowed file jointly.

This may also apply to other government programs.  Assuming that the average voter would object to the reduction for same sex marriages, this may be an argument to oppose such marriages.

Using the misapplied logic:  two gay men raising daughters would be ideal to delay sexual activity of teenage girls! 3.  Con point 3 about divorce is directly contradicted by data. 4.  The slippery slope scare ignores the real harms that come from polygamy, etc.  There are no real harms in extending equality for two consenting adults.   5.

144arg6,"The arguments against are shaky, unfounded, or self-contradicting.  When they say that marriage is a religious union, what about all those atheist couples?  Benjamin Franklin had said, in writing, that religion and government should be separated. They clearly stated that much of the historical purpose of marriage was procreation, implying that married couples who are physically incapable of, or choose not to, have children are not valid. And someone explain to me the correlation between a man and a man or a woman and a woman getting married and, say, a woman and a horse?  There is no connection.  There aren't many, if any, valid and/or strong arguments against gay marriage. One additional thing to add is that, even though the United States Constitution does not directly state a right to privacy, Framers such as James Madison say that government cannot invade the privacy of an individual without good reason.

162arg4,"To say that allowing gay marriage will eventually lead to allowing people to marry animals is ridiculous. For one, people are people, no matter what the sexual preference. And animals wouldn't even be able to sign marriage papers! Many say that it is unnatural. So are the clothes you wear, and most of the things you use in every day life. Some say that it's against their religion. Getting mad at someone for going against your religion is like getting upset with someone for eating a donut because you're on a diet. The Bible bans shaving, gossip, football, mixing fabrics, eating pork and lobster, and so many other things. You can't just pick and choose what to follow. Another argument would be that children need a mother and father. What about all the single parents that raise their kids? Yes, only a man and woman can reproduce, but some marriages that isn't an option. Should we ban infertile and elderly marriages too? And allowing gay marriage won't turn anyone gay just like being around tall people doesn't make you grow. The bottom line is that everyone deserves to be treated equal and fair.

414721894arg6,"No, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.
