oba20,"A definite 'yes'. It seems a lot of people have 'conveniently' forgotten that the Bush administration pretty much sucked the wind out of our nation (and world), with its 'shoot from the hip' policies. TARP money was first brought up by him, and in case your memory is not good, most of the money Bush received could not even be traced. No one seemed to know where it went! His policies began the process of deteriotaton that Obama inherited. By the time Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'. Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with. If you know anything about American politics, you realize, the President's power are limited, and dependent upon Congress. In other words, even if his policies were 'perfect', if Congress decided not to support them, they would go no where.  Perhaps the greatest argument' can be found not just in the political arena, but in the totality of the man. Agree or disagree with his actions, you have to give credit to the fact that he is a man who keeps his promises, and maintains integrity in both his personal and professional life That type of man is more likely to succeed for it takes integrity and committment to accomplsh worthy goals. Everyone will never be pleased 'all the time', but if the individual leading is at least one of good moral fibre, and is reasonably intelligent, he will do the right thing which will serve everyone. Obama is such a man.",p-republicans,"Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'.

I expected him to be something better in 2008, and he's been disappointing in a few areas, but I'd rather see moderate Obama over any of the Republicans.",p-republicans,"I expected him to be something better in 2008, and he's been disappointing in a few areas, but I'd rather see moderate Obama over any of the Republicans.",oba227arg0
oba386,"1. Well, he's trying. We now have ended military involvement in Iraq like he said, he passed healthcare like he said, we've ramped up involvement in Afghanistan like he said, and the economy has improved somewhat - not as fast as anyone would like, but it has improved.  2. Yeah you did, you said if McCain was black and young he'd be in office. This means being black would be one of the prerequisites. I explained why it was not. And as Fox mentions every 10 minutes more people watch fox, and fox has done nothing but demonize Obama from day 1 so by right media's own admission the idea of media choosing the president is logically impossible.  3. same as above. And both the Clinton elections and the Obama election had hundreds of thousands more voters than any Republican election in decades. The numbers say I'm correct.  4. It's my experience that those who ""disagree with his politics"" like prayerfails below is lost in a sea of right wing blogs and fox and actually have no idea what Obama's politics really are. You're going to have to prove a specific issue in some debate in order for me to buy this argument.",p-economy,"Well, he's trying.
