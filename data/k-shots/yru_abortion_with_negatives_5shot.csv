ab116,"well, heres what i think. its ok to abort an unborn child because it is the parents decision to do so. now, once the baby is actually a living creature in your stomach besides just the fetus, it maybe then could be considered illegal since you are killing a baby, not a fetus. so say the fetus develops into an actuall baby at, i dont know 6 months? am i right, wrong? but when its an actuall  baby  and then you abort, then it may be considered murder, so.. all right i'll just break it down  abortion of a fetus:legal  abortion of a baby:  possibly  wrong",c-adopt,0,ab116arg9
ab184,"1. I've yet to see anyone ask a pro-lifer this question; what if a fifteen year old girl is raped, impregnated, and still in school and her parents are unable to support the baby, while the rapist is never caught?     2. Many abortions take place because a family cannot support the baby, or the baby will have some sort of mental disorder to prevent him/her from living life to the fullest. Tell me, would the baby be better off in a world where society discriminates against the mentally challenged, or better in Heaven where things will be perfect and the baby can be taken care of?",p-not_human,1,ab184arg2
ab195,"Well, I think very grey here.  The deal is that at the end of the day, if you had an abortion, well you just killed a future human being. It doesn't matter when conception is or when YOU think that baby actually turned into a real human being. You just killed a life, a future.Â   So yes, at the end of the day... Abortion is essentially murder.Â   However, I think that under any circumstance, a woman should be able to abort her own baby. A woman has her right to her body, it is going to be her pain and her blood and tears going into this young's life. If a woman strongly believes that she isn't prepared for parenthood then she has the right to her own body.Â   It is also the right to her mind. Abortion is not easy, just like any type of surgery it leaves scars. Not only the physical ones but also the mental ones. Women have to deal with the thought of the murder of their own child for the rest of her life. She has to think of the suffering of that child and the pain of her child... That was never even born.Â   Abortion is also risky, woman and their... Umm...... ""companions""/companion..... Should talk over the risks of the surgery and the abortion itself.Â",c-kill,1,ab195arg10
ab411,"So are you saying it's okay to kill something that could potentionally be someone just like you? I can see that it is your point of view, but even though child cannot be killed! It is unnormal and immoral.",c-kill,1,ab411arg10
ab47,"I believe that abortion should be legal because the fetus is simply a part of the mother's body and she can have an abortion because it is her human rights. Also I take this view because every woman can face with situation when two lives are at stake and the moral obligation is to save the one closest at hand--namely, that of the mother, whose life is always more immediate than that of the unborn child within her body.Or enother example, permission for an abortion could then be based on psychiatric considerations such as prepartum depression, especially if there is responsible psychiatric opinion that a continued pregnancy raises the strong probability of suicide in a clinically depressed patient. So, because of these reasons I believe that abortion should be legal.",p-baby_ill_treatment,0,ab47arg4
