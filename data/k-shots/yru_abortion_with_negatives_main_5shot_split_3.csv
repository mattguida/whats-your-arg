ab15,"BS foetuses have brains and central nervous systems...they can feel pain and even hear sounds outside of the womb...do you know anything?   A brain is not a mind. They are separate. A mind is a brain with identity.  They respond to sounds and stimuli, they are not really aware. How could they be aware as we think of it when an infant is only starting to develop this aspect of mind?",p-not_human,1,ab15arg2

ab87,"""So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.""  yes. pollen is plant sperm, that travels to other plants.   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00414.x/full    ""We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms""  Fruits are nothing more than swollen embryonic sacs: they are not only one but many fetuses. If fetuses are alive, apples are alive.   http://appleparermuseum.com/Images/ AppleLongSection560.jpeg    ""Fruit were evolved to be eaten.  I shall cite a reference for you...""  only if we were to defecate into soil, where the seeds take root. However, in most societies, fecal matter finds it way into a barren sewage system, not soil. Therefore, you are aborting said seeds, not allowing them to grow into trees.   http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/ 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00414.x/full    if apples are not the same as the trees they may become, then a fetus is not the same as the person it may become.",c-adopt,0,ab87arg9
ab265,"Funny, I would say since the baby hasn't done anything to you, you shouldn't subjugate it to a life of loneliness and misery. There are already enough unloved orphans in the world, why bring in another?  If I had to choose, I would rather my life be ended as a fetus so I can go find another body to live in, perhaps one with a mother whom would want me for a reason greater than guilt. A reason like  love .",c-other,0,ab265arg14
