414721857arg3,As originally witten the phrase under god was not even added.nnso we should stick with the original form.nIt being said in public schools and sometimes event he workplace is forcing our kids and neighbors to say something they may not be comfortable with.nI am an Atheist and always has been.nI remember not saying that phrase and being punished by my teacher for not following directions and being defiant even though i was only doing what was more comfortable for me.,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,1
414721751arg6,under god implies that the nation as a whole follows this god if you do not follow god then are you excluded from the nation?,America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,2
414721932arg4,"All the pledge is basically saying is that alligiance is pledged to a countrie that was founded upon a divine ideology whereas all people have equal and unalienable. The pledge reads One nation, under God not One nation, where I believe in God. If that were the case, then there'd be some issues...",Likely to be seen as a state sanctioned condemnation of religion,3
414721876arg2,"I am against having the statement Under God in the pledge for two reasons. It is violating the first amendment and the separation of state and church, and it is also offensive to the atheists and the people of other religions. You that you don't have to say it if you don't want to. I am an atheist and I prefer not to say it. For a long time after they take it out (if they do, of course), people will accidentally say it from habit of it being in there so long when it didn't need to. You CAN still be Christian even if the pledge to your country doesn't say Under God.",Removing under god would promote religious tolerance,4
414721881arg1,"The Pledge of Allegiance, in its current form, is a throwback to the days of the Cold War and the ideological fight against the godless Soviet Union.  Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.",Separation of state and religion,5
