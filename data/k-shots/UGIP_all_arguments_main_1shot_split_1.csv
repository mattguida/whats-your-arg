However, somewhere along the way, under God was added and I then became embarrassed to say the Pledge because I thought that under God did not belong there. We are a country with the separation of church and state (thank God, because I believe in God) and for me, having under God in the Pledge belies that fact. If I am now ever in a situation that includes reciting the Pledge, I will of course do so but without saying those two words. The Pledge should belong to all of us and with the words under God in it, I do not think it does. Respectfully submitted.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,2
