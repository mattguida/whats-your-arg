ma148,"I a little bit disagree with you, because as I think everything in this world can compare with something, I mean that any thing in comparison with others can be better or worse, and it always will be, so I want to say in comparison with tabacoo marijuana is more harmful, but accordinh to the same The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) alcohol drinks has bigger danger for health than marijuana.",p-legal,0,ma148arg2
ma215,"Honestly, I thought this debate was over. I got enough opposition. :)  But when I look into legalizing something, I try to look at the worst case scenario and a likely scenario and combine them. In the case of pot, I'm sure a lot of people would go out and buy it to try it or buy it to continue their addictions (don't say it's not addicting. I  know  people that are addicted.) Worst case scenario, half the population would go out and buy it, get high and wreak havoc on America. Productivity would go down :) and some people would simply do reckless things.",c-crime,1,ma215arg9
ma268,"I've never smoked weed in my life, and I strongly believe it should be legalized. Marijuana is safer than some other legal substances, so you can't ban it for that reason. Also you must realize that a prohibition simply does not work. Pot smoking is still a very common phenomena despite it being illegal. legalization, sales, and taxation of marijuana would be hugely beneficial to the economy.  Also there is not a single bit of scientific evidence that can link marijuana usage to other drug usage. Your entire argument rests entirely on speculation.",p-no_damage,0,ma268arg4
ma159,"of course marijuana shoule be legalized. come on, reality check here. more people are gettin in trouble for using, so why not make it legal. we all gonna use it anyway",p-right,1,ma159arg3
ma308,"I've seen you post on a lot of debates, and as funny as your jokes are (/sarcasm), I have to disagree with your point. Although people may not be able to remember things as well while high, I do not believe there has been any study done to see if there is actually a correlation between marijuana use and memory loss. If I am wrong then please post the study. (Also do you think that a little memory loss warrants prohibition?)",p-legal,0,ma308arg2
