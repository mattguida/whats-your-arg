ab111,"So because I disagree with you on capitalism, you're going to stalk and harass me now?  That  is utterly pathetic.  Most children in the adoption system don't get adopted, there's just too many of them.   Hmm, wow that was quick. I guess there just wasn't any real substance to your post. ;)",p-mother_danger,0,ab111arg3
ab271,"A fetus is NOT a human, just a massï»¿ of tissue  Abortion is safer than childbirth  The number of abortions are relatively small  Nobody has the right to impose their morals on others  A woman should be able to control her own body  Abortion must be kept legal, especially for all the rape and incest pregnancies  If abortion is outlawed women will be forced to go to back-alley abortion clinics  Aborting an unwanted fetus reduces the number of abused children",p-right,1,ab271arg0
ab403,"Is an acorn a tree?  Is an egg a chicken?  So on and so on... Grow up..   No, but an acorn is the nut of an oak tree, and a chicken egg is the egg of a chicken, it would be a scientific anomaly if they were to grow into anything else. Are you denying that we are referring to a human fetus? what did you think this debate was about?  Regardless, weâre not talking about an acorn or egg, both of those have all the necessary parts to develop into their adult counterparts on their own, save for proper sunlight and water for the seed or warmth for the egg. A human fetus requires another life to create it and then sustain it until well into adolescence. Whether it is a nine week old fetus or a nine day old newborn baby, it requires another life form. This should be considered  before  people decide to just skip out on the birth control and take the risk of having an unwanted pregnancy.   Personally I don't give a fuck if people get abortions, I doesn't affect me in the least so why should I care? Living things die every day; death is just a part of life. What I  do  care about are people taking responsibility for their actions. If you don't want a baby, no duh, don't get pregnant. If you take the proper precautions to prevent pregnancy and get pregnant anyway or if, god forbid, you were to get raped, then by all means, have an abortion if thatâs what you want. No skin off my nose.  And whatâs with the personal insult? Grow up? I think itâs obvious from that remark alone that I am not the one lacking maturity. Personal attacks like that have no place in a debate.",p-other,0,ab403arg8
ab78,"people (the mother) should have the right to self determination when no other moral agent will be harmed by such actions. fetuses do not gain moral agency until the onset of the third trimester (the point when basic brain activity and consciousness is possible). The reason why this point is the moment of moral agency is because moral agency can only be justifiably attributed to value attributing agents. Because, prior to this, the fetus is not an agent, morality doesnt apply, the fetus has no sovereignty since sovereignty is determined by the awareness of self.   The issue of abortion is not properly about the fetus (unless you are arguing about the 3rd trimester, which no one is), it is properly about the rights of the mother since she is the only person who has any justified claim to sovereignty of her body.",p-right,1,ab78arg0
ab195,"Well, I think very grey here.  The deal is that at the end of the day, if you had an abortion, well you just killed a future human being. It doesn't matter when conception is or when YOU think that baby actually turned into a real human being. You just killed a life, a future.Â   So yes, at the end of the day... Abortion is essentially murder.Â   However, I think that under any circumstance, a woman should be able to abort her own baby. A woman has her right to her body, it is going to be her pain and her blood and tears going into this young's life. If a woman strongly believes that she isn't prepared for parenthood then she has the right to her own body.Â   It is also the right to her mind. Abortion is not easy, just like any type of surgery it leaves scars. Not only the physical ones but also the mental ones. Women have to deal with the thought of the murder of their own child for the rest of her life. She has to think of the suffering of that child and the pain of her child... That was never even born.Â   Abortion is also risky, woman and their... Umm...... ""companions""/companion..... Should talk over the risks of the surgery and the abortion itself.Â",p-other,0,ab195arg8
