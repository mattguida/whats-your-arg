143arg4,"The State gives married people benefits, joint ownership, hospital visitation rights, travel privileges, and many other rights for two people in a loving mutual relationship. People do not choose their gender, people do not choose who they love. The heart chooses who people love. Nobody in the womb says Excuse me Mrs. X Chromosome, please stay away and give me a Y or vice-versa. Gender is out of our control at birth and remains so until people can become trans. To deny people to marry the person they love and give rights to some people but not others is discriminatory hence immoral. To those who say straight marriage is the only traditional institution than why has homosexuality existed in numerous cultures forever alongside heterosexuality in peace and harmony for thousands of years? Also, if you are going to take the Christian path, The Bible never mentions that Jesus condemned homosexuality, and said that all the laws hang on two principles, love your god, and love your neighbor, and every law for Christians must follow one of these. Denying Homosexuality is breaking the second. By denying gay marriage as a Christian people are not loving your neighbor and breaking the highest commandment of Christianity.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
165arg4,"What a sad world we live in when it is legal for people to marry when drunk out of their minds in Las Vegas, and when Hugh Hefner is universally praised for all of his girlfriends, yet, two consenting, and in love homosexual individuals are banned from being wed. AND on top of that, they are chastised and discriminated against just because of their sexual preference. What a sad world we live in...",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
11arg5,"As a gay teenager in high school I don't understand what the big deal is with excepting people for whom they are. People in my school don't think of me any different because I choose a different sexual preference then them, they RESPECT it, the way it should be all over. I have struggled for many years to comprehend this in a biblical aspect, and to be honest, I think its just as biblical as choosing your favorite color. Being gay isn't a choice, if it was the world would be MUCH different. People need to respect people for whom they are. If my partner and I want to have a legalized marriage, nobody should stop me, and quite frankly its discrimination.  The white light streams down to be broken up by those human prisms into all the colors of the rainbow.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,2
48arg7,"I am a homosexual and honestly LOVE IS LOVE and why can't I live with my girlfriend ? So why can't I have a little paper that says I am married to the girl I love? Either way gays will be around and they will live and act like a married couple or go some where else .  And we we can reperdouce ,  by artfical or adoption and raise a child.  SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE GAY atleast they are happy , arent you? Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war.
