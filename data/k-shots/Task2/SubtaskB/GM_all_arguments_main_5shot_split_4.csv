72arg7,"I think gay marriage should be fully legalized around the country because what is the worst thing that is going to come of it? The only thing that's going to happen is a man and a man, and a woman and a woman getting married. It is not like if other people express their homosexuality they are going to force you to be gay. If love should know no age, color, heritage, then it shouldn't know gender either. The Pilgrims came here on a mission to be free of religion telling them what to do and the government dictating their lives. So why should we be doing what is against the Constitution? If people are able to say what they want, they should be able to marry whom they want without the government getting in their way. The government should be totally separate from religion as stated in our constitution as well. People should be able to be who they are and not have to hide their true self from everyone as in a dictatorship, nor should they have to hide the fact that they are homosexual as if they will be exterminated for being so.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
7arg2,"Absolutely No. Who are we to rewrite the creator of this world's view on what marriage is? They deserve the civil union and employment security laws, but rewriting the definition of marriage is going too far!",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,4
95arg4,"It is not possible for a gay couple to enter into a marriage.  Their relationship lacks two key marriage components.  One,  in the marriage of the man and women you have a complete representation of the entire human race.  A gay relationship represents redundancy not completion.  Second, as stated often the very nature of a gay relationship makes it impossible to procreate.  With these two key features missing, marriage is not possible.  Certainly homosexuals can enter in civil unions and should be granted all of the legal rights associated with marriage.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1
56arg4,"I am pro because the Constution states everyone has the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If same-sex marriage makes that person happy then they have the right to do so.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
29arg5,"Gay marriage should be legal because love is love.  I am Christian and I know that apparently it says something in the bible about no gay marriage. But how are we going to base our life off of a book that was written how long ago? God loves his children, and believe it or not, he loves his gay/bisexual children too. They were born this way, straight, gay, or bi.  Everyone who thinks other should check themselves.  They are on the wrong side of history. If you don't believe in gay marriage, don't marry someone the same gender as you. Simple as that.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,2
