38arg7,God didnt say that men and men should get married or women and women. The world is coming to an end and in the bible it is said that the sins of the people will grow and this is happening. We dont want our children growing up and thinking that oh its okay to marry somone of their own sex. Next think you know our children will be getting married with animals. Like me some people dont want gay marriage to be allowed and we want our rights to be respected. Like in the word of God it is said that he created a women so the man wouldnt be alone he never said he created women so the womwn wouldnt be alone. Like I said in the beginig yhe world is coming to an end and Gods arrival is getting close and does who didnt follow his law and acepted him as his saviour will not be welcomed to heaven. Only the brave ones will be welcomed.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,5
