87arg7,Im against same sex marriages.  It is the way I was raised and that I have grown up believing is correct.  They cannot reproduce and I feel they or it encourages more wrong in our society.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4
151arg7,"The only purpose of marriage in the eyes of the law is to establish legal kinship where none existed previously. ALL else is personal.  This negates the false 'it will lead to polygamy' slippery slope meme, and also the 'should a man be allowed to marry his daughter' nonsense. It also negates the ' it's like a man marryin' a dog/table/rock' idiocies, since none of these (non-humans) can give legal consent to enter into a marriage contract.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,2
52arg4,"I am doing an essay in school about pros and cons. this is the website we chose to use. i feel that gay marriage has nothing to do with gender or religion. marriage is marriage. love is love. if a woman and a woman or a man and a man love each other, then let them be. they have nothing to do with your life. why interupt their life when you gain nothing from doing so? plus, the government cannot force a church to marry a gay couple. they can only control the state. so for all of the religions out there agaisnt gay marriage, (i'm sorry, people who say their religion is against gay marriage) the government cannot do anything to you. i think that religions do not hate them, or not like them, they fear them. they fear the unknown. human minds have to make sense of things. this is an example. now, stop discriminating agaisnt people. it is against the constitution. this is a FREE country, and they deserve to be FREE too!!! that is how this country was made. for religous frreedom. they have as much right has we do to marry. marriage is about LOVE. not race, ethnicity or gender. before you hate gays or dont like them, look up the facts. dont base it on religion. i, am not gay. i am just supporting them. because it is human nature to do so.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
193arg5,"one of the main reasons that gay marriage isn't legal is because of religious views, however government and religion are meant to be SEPARATE!!",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
26arg2,"Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,5
