173arg7,"You will never change people's minds about the legitimacy of homosexuality and other sexual variations. These are strict taboos , especially that of male homosexuality, and have been since time out of mind - rightly or wrongly. Most people cannot even discuss this with you because the subject is so distasteful . Marriage came about before religion. It grew and developed within religion. Most  religions do not accept - cannot accept - anything other than heterosexuality. Thousands of cartoons, insults and jibes will not force people to change their minds about these taboos. In this country we've moved at least a 500 years in the last 30 years in our consciousness because of your dogged determination. People are now sensitized to the concept of alternate sexualities and the right of all people to be happy being themselves. But marriage?  Many people cannot wrap their minds around what you are suggesting. .  I propose that ALL unions in the US be termed civil unions. A national mandate, not state by state. Any two adults should be able to unite whether for love, for, sex, for financial stability or for fun. Let the government move out of 'the marriage business.'",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4
10arg4,"Any person should have the ability to marry if they wish. What other people think doesn't matter. If you are against homosexual union because of your religious beliefs, or other personal beliefs, it shouldn't and doesn't affect how two people choose to live their lives. Frankly, it's none of your business! Everybody should have the right to be happy, and whether devoting your life to your church makes you happy, or being married to someone of the same sex makes you happy, or not being married at all makes you happy, it's still your right, and no one should be allowed to take that away from you. You can choose to live your life the way you want, so let others choose the way they want to live.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
88arg4,"Immorality should never has A SAY,should never be accepted as something normal  .Marriage is between a man and a woman not between 2 men or 2 women .is against our nature ,against our God.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,2
158arg4,"These are boys and girls that have been planning weddings since they were kids. These are boys and girls who have already been tortured in the hallways of schools. These are the boys and girls who ate their lunch at a table by themselves. These are the boys and girls who have wondered why they're even living. These are the boys and girls who have struggled with identity the most. These are boys and girls who's religious family/friends have turned them down and hated them. These are boys and girls who have had to hide who they really are from society. These are boys and girls who have to stop being in love as soon as they walk out the door. The least we can do is let them marry.  I can't help but notice that all the arguments on the CON side, are religious or say that it's wrong because they can't reproduce.  Well, news flash, my friends; these people obviously don't believe in the bible, and, chances are, aren't going to.  And what about infertile couples? Besides, marriage isn't about kids. There are so many couples that end up not having kids.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,4
26arg6,"Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.","Marriage is about more than procreation, therefore gay couples should not be denied the right to marry due to their biology.",1
