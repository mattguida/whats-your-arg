72arg7,"I think gay marriage should be fully legalized around the country because what is the worst thing that is going to come of it? The only thing that's going to happen is a man and a man, and a woman and a woman getting married. It is not like if other people express their homosexuality they are going to force you to be gay. If love should know no age, color, heritage, then it shouldn't know gender either. The Pilgrims came here on a mission to be free of religion telling them what to do and the government dictating their lives. So why should we be doing what is against the Constitution? If people are able to say what they want, they should be able to marry whom they want without the government getting in their way. The government should be totally separate from religion as stated in our constitution as well. People should be able to be who they are and not have to hide their true self from everyone as in a dictatorship, nor should they have to hide the fact that they are homosexual as if they will be exterminated for being so.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
91arg7,In the Bible marriage is defined by God as a union between a man and a woman.  To give marriage to a gay couple would change the definition of marriage for many religious persons thereby denying their religious freedom.  Giving a gay couple the right to use the word marriage also gives the gay community the right to call themselves normal.  And lets face they are not normal.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,5
95arg4,"It is not possible for a gay couple to enter into a marriage.  Their relationship lacks two key marriage components.  One,  in the marriage of the man and women you have a complete representation of the entire human race.  A gay relationship represents redundancy not completion.  Second, as stated often the very nature of a gay relationship makes it impossible to procreate.  With these two key features missing, marriage is not possible.  Certainly homosexuals can enter in civil unions and should be granted all of the legal rights associated with marriage.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,1
63arg1,"I don't believe in gay marriage. Here's why: The word marriage was defined as between a man and a woman by the Christian religion years ago. It was a religious institution before we roped it in with benefits. So why don't we not put marriage under the law (by under the law, I mean with the documents, and sharing benefits, etc). How about if there is a want to be legally joined together the US calls it a civil union. Everyone gets one who wants to be together. Then, if one is religious, they can perform their own religious ceremony, whether it is a marriage in a church, or something else. This way everyone is equal (everyone gets a civil union), there is a separation of church and state (civil union under the state, and a religious ceremony under church), yet marriage retains it's sacredness for the Christians. Everyone is happy.",Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,5
56arg4,"I am pro because the Constution states everyone has the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If same-sex marriage makes that person happy then they have the right to do so.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
