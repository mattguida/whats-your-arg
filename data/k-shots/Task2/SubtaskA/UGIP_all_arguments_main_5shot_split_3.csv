414721846arg2,"'God' is not an irrefutable fact; it is a personal belief, a byproduct of religion which this country was founded on the freedom of, for, or none at all.  There is no proof of gods existence and religion and state MUST be separate in order for all US citizens to be included. Taking the phrase out would do absolutely no harm to any religion or practicing religious people in this country, but it would include every citizen without anyone or any belief system being disregarded, disrespected or left out.  That is why i feel it must be omitted from the pledge.",Removing under god would promote religious tolerance,5
414721926arg3,I am for the under God in the US pledge of Allegiance because this is what our country is based on and I believe that if we don't get back to stand point in our country then there is honestly going to be no hope for America.,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
414721881arg3,"The Pledge of Allegiance, in its current form, is a throwback to the days of the Cold War and the ideological fight against the godless Soviet Union.  Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.",Under God  is part of American tradition and history,1
414721698arg1,"This is ridiculous. All those opposed to saying under God, you don't have to say it. I don't know why you would want to anyway. If you take that out we might as well change all the laws our country has seeing how they are based the many 10 commandments (i.e. lying (fraud), murder, stealing, adultery). If you take God out of this then you are begging for even more corruption in our government. If you have ever lived in a country dealing with that (and I have) it wouldn't bother you to say under God.",Separation of state and religion,1
414721697arg3,This has been part of or countries pledge for over 100 years. Why would anyone be affended by it. If they want to be a part of our country then why don't just accept the verses of our pledge. If you dont like our pledge then go back to your country!!,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
