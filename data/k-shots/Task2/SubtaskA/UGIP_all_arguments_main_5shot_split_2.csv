414721699arg3,"We are wasting our time trying to remove every glimpse of faith and heritage from this nation. 52 of the 55 signers of the Declaration of Independence were church members and Christians. Get over it! It is completely ridiculous to cater to the minority the way this nation has become so famous for doing. Listen, 82% of Americans say they believe in God. If you don't, don't say under God, but leave the other 82% alone.",Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
414721659arg1,"The Pledge of Allegiance reflects our morals and values. Therefore, it should reflect the ideas of all americans not 80%. This country has no national religion, so why should we promote a god. Also, Thomas Jefferson, a founding father, was athiest.",Separation of state and religion,5
414721698arg1,"This is ridiculous. All those opposed to saying under God, you don't have to say it. I don't know why you would want to anyway. If you take that out we might as well change all the laws our country has seeing how they are based the many 10 commandments (i.e. lying (fraud), murder, stealing, adultery). If you take God out of this then you are begging for even more corruption in our government. If you have ever lived in a country dealing with that (and I have) it wouldn't bother you to say under God.",Separation of state and religion,1
414721688arg1,"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  The idea of a single God is opposed to ideas of polytheistic religions and those who have no belief in a creator. Although the pledge not mandatory but is a law under the Flag Code, the phrase under God praises the ideas of some the religions that are set with the idea of a single God.",Separation of state and religion,5
414721769arg6,"I am CON because the statement Under God was only put into the pledge because the US is deemed a christian nation. This is untrue. Just because our country has a high rate of christians doesnt mean we are a 'christian nation'. The US has a significant amount of people who arent religious, and that amount is only growing. I think its wrong to have this saying in the pledge because we shouldnt speak for every person in the country. Also we have a separation of church and state for a reason.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,1
