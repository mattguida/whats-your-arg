414721881arg3,"The Pledge of Allegiance, in its current form, is a throwback to the days of the Cold War and the ideological fight against the godless Soviet Union.  Even though I wasn't around for the Cold War, I understand why under God was added, mostly to say This is America, not the Soviet Union!  We're better because we believe in God!  Similar reasoning applies for making the national motto In God We Trust.  What, exactly, does people trusting in God say about the US as a country?  Looking at it from a secular point of view, I think that's an inferior motto to E Pluribus Unum, which sums up this country perfectly.  Lots of people don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity, and not just the nonreligious.  Is the government calling all of those people unpatriotic?  The answer is definitely yes.  Here's a simple test:  Try replacing it with under Allah or under Vishnu.  Think that's any different?  It's not.  Same message, just aimed at different groups.  From the Bible Belt, here's a vote to get under God out of the Pledge, and for E Pluribus Unum as the motto.",Under God  is part of American tradition and history,1
414721769arg6,"I am CON because the statement Under God was only put into the pledge because the US is deemed a christian nation. This is untrue. Just because our country has a high rate of christians doesnt mean we are a 'christian nation'. The US has a significant amount of people who arent religious, and that amount is only growing. I think its wrong to have this saying in the pledge because we shouldnt speak for every person in the country. Also we have a separation of church and state for a reason.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,1
414721877arg1,"the separation between church and state keeps america from becoming like one of those crazy theocracies (such as in the middle east, like Iran) As such it would be best if the under God is removed.",Separation of state and religion,5
414721857arg3,As originally witten the phrase under god was not even added.nnso we should stick with the original form.nIt being said in public schools and sometimes event he workplace is forcing our kids and neighbors to say something they may not be comfortable with.nI am an Atheist and always has been.nI remember not saying that phrase and being punished by my teacher for not following directions and being defiant even though i was only doing what was more comfortable for me.,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,1
