139arg7,"Thank you God   Gays say it is the same, let's examine that statement. Man + women = man and women ok man + man + man and man not the same. Woman + woman + woman and woman not the same. Why do gay people always flaunt their gayness they want you to believe that they are a race, ethnic group which they are neither. The want the right to destroy other people's children with their doctrine. The gays want  gay doctrine taught in schools. Why do school age children need to be worried about such perversion.  Innocent children only see the truth and will speak on it now the gay left is pushing the BULLYING agenda, because they do not want to hear that they are wrong. Gay people always want to tell the world I'm gay, why. Hetrosexuals don't go around saying I'm straight all day  Gay people say it is the 21st century well what was wrong in the 1st century is still wrong today. If we were all gay we would not be reproducing. So it would only end in the death of mankind. Gays have only hurt our country with divisions.  I hate no one, nor is this about hate it's about not believeing the lie.God Bless all and America read the Bible gay people it will become clear",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,5

48arg7,"I am a homosexual and honestly LOVE IS LOVE and why can't I live with my girlfriend ? So why can't I have a little paper that says I am married to the girl I love? Either way gays will be around and they will live and act like a married couple or go some where else .  And we we can reperdouce ,  by artfical or adoption and raise a child.  SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE GAY atleast they are happy , arent you? Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
143arg4,"The State gives married people benefits, joint ownership, hospital visitation rights, travel privileges, and many other rights for two people in a loving mutual relationship. People do not choose their gender, people do not choose who they love. The heart chooses who people love. Nobody in the womb says Excuse me Mrs. X Chromosome, please stay away and give me a Y or vice-versa. Gender is out of our control at birth and remains so until people can become trans. To deny people to marry the person they love and give rights to some people but not others is discriminatory hence immoral. To those who say straight marriage is the only traditional institution than why has homosexuality existed in numerous cultures forever alongside heterosexuality in peace and harmony for thousands of years? Also, if you are going to take the Christian path, The Bible never mentions that Jesus condemned homosexuality, and said that all the laws hang on two principles, love your god, and love your neighbor, and every law for Christians must follow one of these. Denying Homosexuality is breaking the second. By denying gay marriage as a Christian people are not loving your neighbor and breaking the highest commandment of Christianity.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
