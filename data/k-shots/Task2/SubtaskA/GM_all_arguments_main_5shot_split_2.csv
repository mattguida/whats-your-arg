10arg4,"Any person should have the ability to marry if they wish. What other people think doesn't matter. If you are against homosexual union because of your religious beliefs, or other personal beliefs, it shouldn't and doesn't affect how two people choose to live their lives. Frankly, it's none of your business! Everybody should have the right to be happy, and whether devoting your life to your church makes you happy, or being married to someone of the same sex makes you happy, or not being married at all makes you happy, it's still your right, and no one should be allowed to take that away from you. You can choose to live your life the way you want, so let others choose the way they want to live.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
91arg5,In the Bible marriage is defined by God as a union between a man and a woman.  To give marriage to a gay couple would change the definition of marriage for many religious persons thereby denying their religious freedom.  Giving a gay couple the right to use the word marriage also gives the gay community the right to call themselves normal.  And lets face they are not normal.,Major world religions are against gay marriages,5

11arg4,"As a gay teenager in high school I don't understand what the big deal is with excepting people for whom they are. People in my school don't think of me any different because I choose a different sexual preference then them, they RESPECT it, the way it should be all over. I have struggled for many years to comprehend this in a biblical aspect, and to be honest, I think its just as biblical as choosing your favorite color. Being gay isn't a choice, if it was the world would be MUCH different. People need to respect people for whom they are. If my partner and I want to have a legalized marriage, nobody should stop me, and quite frankly its discrimination.  The white light streams down to be broken up by those human prisms into all the colors of the rainbow.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
26arg6,"Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.","Marriage is about more than procreation, therefore gay couples should not be denied the right to marry due to their biology.",1
