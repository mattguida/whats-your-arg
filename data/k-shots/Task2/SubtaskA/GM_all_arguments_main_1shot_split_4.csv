168arg4,"Why should two people be denied marriage just because of their sexuality? Have people grown that shallow? I look at the Con comments and they make me sick. You are actually going to hide behind religion. Last time I checked marriage was for people who are in love not just between a man and woman. Why should a LESBIAN be miserable in a marriage just because they cant get married to the one they love. You people are promoting cheating and crumbling marriage. All you want to do is discriminate against the gays because we are what you call HAPPY, :D we love people for what is in the inside and not just what they have on the outside.  As for your infomation im happy ENGAGED to my girlfriend and we are getting married rather you close minded people like it or not. By the way, one day you guys will loose and it will be legal in the U.S. I mean its legal for gays to be in the military whats stopping the states from legalizing it. Personally not everybody believes in the Bible or any religion. So why deny people marriage just because a selected few think its immoral. Whats immoral in discrimination and thats whats you are doing",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
