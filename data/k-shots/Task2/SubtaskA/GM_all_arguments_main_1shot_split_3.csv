It's kind of like having a driver's license in IL then going to WI, it's valid and just the same. So, in theory if one state legalizes gay marriage and the couples disperse throughout the U.S. every state SHOULD recognize it. I cannot wait until states start losing federal funding over this.

Hopefully we don't have the same bigots and hateful people in office so things can fall into place. Separate the church and the state. Marriage has been seen in more recent times as a religious term, even given to atheists. And if all sin is the same in the eyes of god, why is it any different giving homosexuals the ability to use that term? Legalizing gay marriage would increase revenue, stop legal discrimination against the newly created and heavily ostracized minority and enable love to flourish.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
