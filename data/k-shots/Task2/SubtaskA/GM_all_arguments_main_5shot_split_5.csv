158arg5,"These are boys and girls that have been planning weddings since they were kids. These are boys and girls who have already been tortured in the hallways of schools. These are the boys and girls who ate their lunch at a table by themselves. These are the boys and girls who have wondered why they're even living. These are the boys and girls who have struggled with identity the most. These are boys and girls who's religious family/friends have turned them down and hated them. These are boys and girls who have had to hide who they really are from society. These are boys and girls who have to stop being in love as soon as they walk out the door. The least we can do is let them marry.  I can't help but notice that all the arguments on the CON side, are religious or say that it's wrong because they can't reproduce.  Well, news flash, my friends; these people obviously don't believe in the bible, and, chances are, aren't going to.  And what about infertile couples? Besides, marriage isn't about kids. There are so many couples that end up not having kids.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
26arg6,"Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.","Marriage is about more than procreation, therefore gay couples should not be denied the right to marry due to their biology.",1
52arg4,"I am doing an essay in school about pros and cons. this is the website we chose to use. i feel that gay marriage has nothing to do with gender or religion. marriage is marriage. love is love. if a woman and a woman or a man and a man love each other, then let them be. they have nothing to do with your life. why interupt their life when you gain nothing from doing so? plus, the government cannot force a church to marry a gay couple. they can only control the state. so for all of the religions out there agaisnt gay marriage, (i'm sorry, people who say their religion is against gay marriage) the government cannot do anything to you. i think that religions do not hate them, or not like them, they fear them. they fear the unknown. human minds have to make sense of things. this is an example. now, stop discriminating agaisnt people. it is against the constitution. this is a FREE country, and they deserve to be FREE too!!! that is how this country was made. for religous frreedom. they have as much right has we do to marry. marriage is about LOVE. not race, ethnicity or gender. before you hate gays or dont like them, look up the facts. dont base it on religion. i, am not gay. i am just supporting them. because it is human nature to do so.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
193arg5,"one of the main reasons that gay marriage isn't legal is because of religious views, however government and religion are meant to be SEPARATE!!",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
