414721698arg1,"This is ridiculous. All those opposed to saying under God, you don't have to say it. I don't know why you would want to anyway. If you take that out we might as well change all the laws our country has seeing how they are based the many 10 commandments (i.e. lying (fraud), murder, stealing, adultery). If you take God out of this then you are begging for even more corruption in our government. If you have ever lived in a country dealing with that (and I have) it wouldn't bother you to say under God.",Separation of state and religion,1
414721902arg6,"I do not think that it is appropriate to have the phrase Under God in the United States of America Pledge. I do not think this because I have anything against Christianity or God, I simply think that, seeing as America was created for religious freedom, we should not expect our citizens to pledge themselves to a god that they may or may not believe in.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,2
414721813arg4,"I believe that since this country was founded under God why should we take that out of the pledge? Men and women have fought and gave their lives for this country, so that way we can have freedom and be able to have God in our lives. And since this country was founded under God and the Ten Commandments in mind, it needs to stay in. If it offends you well I am sorry but get out of this country!",Likely to be seen as a state sanctioned condemnation of religion,3
414721866arg1,"Theocracy is in our midst---7.US churches have been tax-exempt for over 200 years, yet there are no signs that America has become a theocracy.(Hello?) If the tax exemption were a serious threat to the separation of church and state, the US government would have succumbed to religious rule long ago. (More reason for Churches and Church Related organizations to be penalized for raising funds and waging campaigns with Civil outcomes) As the Supreme Court ruled in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York (1970), freedom from taxation for two centuries has not led to an established church or religion, and, on the contrary, has helped to guarantee the free exercise of all forms of religious belief. [18]How about Spiritual but non-Religious beliefs Sir?) The Holy Roman Ctholic Church (Official name of Corporation) distances itself from its Priesthood by making clergy Contractors, not paying Social Security for them, making them pay income taxes and including as Income living in the Rectory where they are forced to reside.",Separation of state and religion,4
414721697arg3,This has been part of or countries pledge for over 100 years. Why would anyone be affended by it. If they want to be a part of our country then why don't just accept the verses of our pledge. If you dont like our pledge then go back to your country!!,Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
