ma209,"Ahhh, yes. Of course everyone who does weed will do other drugs. Clearly you don't know anyone who smokes weed and your just reciting the DARE propaganda they told you. If something harmless like weed can lead to something dangerous like meth, than drinking milk leads to vodka. Not everyone who smokes weed is stupid enough to try any other drug. And you don't build up tolerance and NEED something. I know tons of people who smoke everyday and get better grades than non smokers, haven't tried any other drugs, and are less zombie like than someone spouting out propaganda someone told to them.   And btw, all my friends who smoke are usually A LOT more interesting than people who don't.",c-addiction,0,ma209arg10
ma110,"Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I think we could save so much time and money just by treating Marijuana like a mixture of Cigarettes and Alcohol.  You don't smoke in public places.  You don't drive while under the influence.  And we can tax it. I'd bet it would still be cheaper than today. It wouldn't be such a risk to transport and sell, and more people would be doing it.",p-legal,1,ma110arg2
ma361,"Marijuana is one of the popular agricultural products in the US. According to an estimate by Californian authorities, annual marijuana sales in the state could be worth 14 billion dollars. And new tax revenues from legalizing marijuana could well exceed 1 billion dollars, just in California. Imagine what the revenue will be if it is legalized in the whole of US!",c-crime,0,ma361arg9
ma373,"Correction, marijuana is not a drug it is a substance. Sure it makes you sleepy and hungry but it also makes you happy! You left that part out.",p-medicine,1,ma373arg1
