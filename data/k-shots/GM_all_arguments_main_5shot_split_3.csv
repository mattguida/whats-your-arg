48arg7,"I am a homosexual and honestly LOVE IS LOVE and why can't I live with my girlfriend ? So why can't I have a little paper that says I am married to the girl I love? Either way gays will be around and they will live and act like a married couple or go some where else .  And we we can reperdouce ,  by artfical or adoption and raise a child.  SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE GAY atleast they are happy , arent you? Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,1
11arg5,"As a gay teenager in high school I don't understand what the big deal is with excepting people for whom they are. People in my school don't think of me any different because I choose a different sexual preference then them, they RESPECT it, the way it should be all over. I have struggled for many years to comprehend this in a biblical aspect, and to be honest, I think its just as biblical as choosing your favorite color. Being gay isn't a choice, if it was the world would be MUCH different. People need to respect people for whom they are. If my partner and I want to have a legalized marriage, nobody should stop me, and quite frankly its discrimination.  The white light streams down to be broken up by those human prisms into all the colors of the rainbow.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,2
167arg2,"Whether one is homosexual or heterosexual is not due to any learned response.  Both homosexuals and heterosexuals are what they are because nature made them so.  All persons should be treated as human beings. No person should be oppressed simply because that person is different or thinks differently than another person.  The real reason that some people want the14th Amendment repealed, is because treating people equally doesn't fit, Their  Freedom of Religion.  All humans, whether believers or non-believers, deserve the same treatment.  Churches that recognize homosexual marriage are excersing their Freedom of Religion just as much as Churches that do not recognize homosexual marriage.  The U. S.Constitution and several State Constitutions say both concepts are in fact protected Freedom of Religion, and cannot be expressed in a manner that makes one concept superior to the other.  Some of these Constitutions say this expressly, and some imply it through Construction and implication, which is a necessary and proper way to interpret all of those Constitutions.  Making homosexual marriage a moral issue makes it a to be of the Pharisees and Sadduccees that I must be 10 times more righteous than to get to the Kingdom of Heaven.",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,3
87arg7,Im against same sex marriages.  It is the way I was raised and that I have grown up believing is correct.  They cannot reproduce and I feel they or it encourages more wrong in our society.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4
143arg4,"The State gives married people benefits, joint ownership, hospital visitation rights, travel privileges, and many other rights for two people in a loving mutual relationship. People do not choose their gender, people do not choose who they love. The heart chooses who people love. Nobody in the womb says Excuse me Mrs. X Chromosome, please stay away and give me a Y or vice-versa. Gender is out of our control at birth and remains so until people can become trans. To deny people to marry the person they love and give rights to some people but not others is discriminatory hence immoral. To those who say straight marriage is the only traditional institution than why has homosexuality existed in numerous cultures forever alongside heterosexuality in peace and harmony for thousands of years? Also, if you are going to take the Christian path, The Bible never mentions that Jesus condemned homosexuality, and said that all the laws hang on two principles, love your god, and love your neighbor, and every law for Christians must follow one of these. Denying Homosexuality is breaking the second. By denying gay marriage as a Christian people are not loving your neighbor and breaking the highest commandment of Christianity.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
