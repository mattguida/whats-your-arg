ma176,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",p-not_addictive,1,ma176arg0
ma253,"Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary ""Should I smoke Pot?"" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a ""druggy"" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.",c-mind,1,ma253arg7
ma37,"Why do you assume if marijuana is legalized that everyone will start doing it habitually? You have nothing to back this view up and the history of prohibition would actually disagree with your statement.  ""the fact of the matter is that if you smoke pot long enough your mind will strictly be wrapped around trying to get high.""  Marijuana is not physically addictive. Yet one of the most addictive substances known, nicotine, is perfectly legal to have in cigarettes. Alcohol is also very illegal. There are thousands of deaths every year from tobacco and alcohol, yet there has never been a recorded death due to marijuana. Unless you support making cigarettes and alcohol illegal, your position is not logically consistent.  Furthermore your assumption that people who smoke pot are not productive members of society is simply not the case. 50% of the population has smoked marijuana at least one time. And the past three presidents have admitted to smoking pot. You can very easily be a very successful habitual smoker, but it is far more difficult to be a fully functional alcoholic. Yet once again I doubt you support prohibition of alcohol.  Your argument is based upon incorrect assumptions and contradictions. Try again.",p-legal,1,ma37arg2
