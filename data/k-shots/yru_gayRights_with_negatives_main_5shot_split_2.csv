gr326,"You claim that the rights should be given   The same rights given to homosexual couples as to heterosexual couples.   Marriages have benefits.   Well, depending on your definition of ""benefits"" (legal or social), this could be a fact or a debatable opinion.   Your reasoning is extend them to be fair, but that's a fallacy: Why should the state give them costly benifits?   1) How is that a fallacy?  2) YOUR refute is a fallacy, a special pleading fallacy. You ask why the state should give them costly benefits, yet you ignore that the state is giving  hetero sexual couples the same costly benefits that we are arguing over with  homo sexual couples. If you wish to point out why the state should give them costly benefits, you surely need to be fair and ask that about ALL groups that ARE given those costly benefits versus the ones you do not think that should.   So what reason is there to allow them union?   They bring no harm and it's not our place to legislate in the affairs of consenting adults wishing to love when no other harmful factors have been proven. The gay couple down the street does not affect or effect my marriage with my husband and if they were to marry, STILL do not alter my marriage.   None!   You haven't refuted any of my statements.   As my last argument proved the state sees marriage as a procreative type union and therefore the government has no reason to allow it.   And what last argument proves that?  You know what? For the shits and giggles of it all, let's pretend you DID indeed prove that the state sees marriage as a procreative type union; why does the state allow infertile  hetero sexual (straight) couples to marry; this includes the elderly, those who choose a surgery which makes them infertile, those who choose not to have kids and those with a disorder that disallows them the ability for procreation? If marriage is about procreation, these groups should not be allowed to marry as well....",p-normal,1,gr326arg0
gr321,"""don't call it marriage.""  Well, marriage is actually a civil union. It is licensed by a civil authority and it is the union of two people. So lets stop calling anything ""marriage"", at least legally, and let consenting adults form a civil union with the person they love. And if they want, some of them might want to do that in their church or temple!",c-threat_to_child,0,gr321arg8
