414721738arg1,"God should be everywhere in our great America.  Whether it's on our money, in our Pledge, prayers in school, saying Merry Christmas, the nativity scene, crosses in all cemeteries, sayings on our historical buildings.  ALL OF IT.  This United States was built on God's love  belief.  It should always be that way.",Separation of state and religion,1
414721757arg6,"I grew up with a Pledge that did not include under God in it. I was always happy to say that Pledge, which had great meaning for me.  However, somewhere along the way, under God was added and I then became embarrassed to say the Pledge because I thought that under God did not belong there. We are a country with the separation of church and state (thank God, because I believe in God) and for me, having under God in the Pledge belies that fact. If I am now ever in a situation that includes reciting the Pledge, I will of course do so but without saying those two words. The Pledge should belong to all of us and with the words under God in it, I do not think it does. Respectfully submitted.",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,2
414721831arg6,"Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise. - James Madison   Genius that statement was written in refrence to a tyrant that would have forced you to say under God on pain of DEATH! And the simple yet increadibly important thing that all you Cons seem to be forgetting is that NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SAY OR BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU DONT WANT TO!!!! Since it was added 58 Years ago no one has been forced to believe in God, or put to death for not believing in the Almighty, nor has anyone been incarcerated for not saying those words in the pledge so quit all your meaningless bitching about how your looking for attention and want everyone to look at you, cause we both know thats what all of this is really and truely about. When we get down to the core you all just want to have everyones attention while you create problems for 89% of the country! I'll say it again for the slow ones that are a little behind, NO....ONE....IS....FORCING....YOU....TO....BELIEVE....IN....GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",America is based on democracy and the pledge should reflect the belief of the American majority.,4
414721727arg3,"Those words have been part of our Pledge of Allegiance since the beginning and I don't think we should dismantle it because of those uber-sensitive who think we are corrupting our children.  I am agnostic myself, but it does not offend me to recite those words.",Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
414721922arg3,"I believe the words 'under God' should remain in our pledge. This country was founded on solid Christian principals. We have been blessed and became a great nation because we believed and lived up to these principals. The farther we get from our source of greatness which is God, the more morally corrupt we become. Our nation is being destroyed from within as we continue to take God out of our lives.",Under God  is part of American tradition and history,5
