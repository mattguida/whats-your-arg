gr392,"Yes, it should be legal.   - Homosexuality is a natural phenomenon; it's just that you're attracted more to the people of the same sex.  - Everyone has the right to be happy, so they deserve the things in which they find their happiness.  - On one hand we talk of equality, and on the other depriving homosexuals from it. Isn't it kind of ironical? I mean, so what if they're of the same sex? Aren't they entitled to love each other?  - No religious books (as far as I know) have ridiculed the whole notion of homosexuality. On the other hand, all of them have a common theme, that is, accepting people as they are, loving them as they are, and that everyone deserves to be happy.  - It has already been legalized in many countries. There are records of successful gay marriages; it isn't that only heterosexual marriages are successful.",c-Other,0,gr392arg10
gr469,"""Saying that this country allows oppression is a false accusation? You need to read over American history again. The slaughter of Native Americans, slavery, segregation, Japanese internment camps are all particularly relevant.""   Thats  exactly  why I said  ""going on right now"" . Do you remember that? Or do you have selective reading?   As for the video, I see where you are coming from with the 'fear mongering'. But the thing is, everything in that video is true. If I don't want my kids being taught that homosexuality is normal or okay why should I have to worry about it?   I believe that it is wrong. In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country. Instead of fear mongering and saying that religion is bad because it will oppress you.",c-Other,1,gr469arg10

gr233,"They should have the same rights as the rest of us. If I can get married, why can't Bob and Joe get married?  If your answer includes religious reasons or personal disgust, it has no validity in the legal decision.  If your answer includes a claim of a significant wrong, like it endangers children; you're going to need to PROVE this completely, and maybe we'll consider it.",p-religion,1,gr233arg4
gr344,"So let me get this straight. Their lifestyle denies US citizens of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. So your argument to combat that is to...deny homosexuals (also US citizens) the chance of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.  Hmm, seems a bit contradictory.  I guess we should put a stop to divorce as well. Also higher rates of depression and suicide, effects children, decreased well-being, etc. Are you going to argue that should be abolished as well?",p-religion,0,gr344arg4
