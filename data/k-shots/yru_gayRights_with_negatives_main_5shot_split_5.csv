gr9,"Firstly:  Gay relationships:  The majority of gay relationships last shorter then 6 months. (1)  Very few gay relationships surpas 2 years. (2)  Only 2.7% of gays have 1 partner throughout their whole life. (3)  One study says they have 8 sexual partners per year. (4)  Another said they have 500-1000 throughout their whole life. (5)  Why should these rights be granted?   The goverment has no reason to grant these benefits. The goverment wants procreative type unions. (6)  Now, there are many economic benefits the goverment gives marriage, so this indicates they do this for certain goals they wish to accomplish, their goal: procreative type unions with child rearing. (6) as homosexuals cannot do this they fail.  Discrimination:  A common argument, and one that will likely be stated, is that banning SSM is discrimination. Actually, as marriage is about procreative type relationships then it isn't discrimination based off of sexuality, but rather nature. (7, 8) and have a procreative type relationship. As Homosexuals can never produce children and/or have a procreative type relationship, then it is not discrimination as we bar them this right through nature. (7, 8) Marriage in culture is usually viewed as a male and a female + children. As marriage is a large part of this culture, banning SSM is popular to common marriage stereotypes. (7, 8)   Further more for it to be in discriminating in effect is must be a right, as discrimination to a privilege is just. (7,8) Aristotle saw this as what you deserved, not what is given. (8, 9)    As you must prove in the states eyes they deserve this ritual/legal ""right"" then my argument on rights is void, if you cannot prove in the states eyes they deserve this then you have lost.
