gr332,"Gay marriage and homosexuality aren't quite the same thing, just as how straight marriage and heterosexuality aren't quite the same thing (e.g. a gay man can get married to a woman, but that wouldn't magically turn him into a straight man), but that's not the point I was trying to make. What I'm saying is that providing Biblical evidence will only help you to convince Christians. Non-Christians won't see any reason to ban gay marriage just because the Bible says it's wrong.",p-no_threat_for_child,0,gr332arg2

gr445,"Men can be attracted to Men.. BUT... Gay Marriage shouldn't be accepted. Think about it, What will happen if Gays are accepted? There will be an increasing amount of Gays. That will create population decrease everywhere, and that's going to lead to an end in the human population.",c-gay_problems,1,gr445arg9
gr51,"Hello, Terminator. The issue isn't about sex. It's about whether certain people should be allowed to marry. I've been reading some of your posts and it doesn't seem to be the case that you actually have a reason as to why homosexuals shouldn't be allowed to marry.   Prove it.   It's simple. You can get married without the religious ritual. But you can't get married without a state license. The ritual has historically acted as a rite of passage, but not the actual thing that makes you ""married"".   Does marriage have a religious origin?   No. Marriage has always been a state institution, always requiring the recognition of the state regardless of what ritual religious or secular is attached to it.",p-religion,1,gr51arg4
gr66,"We have an overpopulation problem in the US. In the world, actually. Yes, homosexual couples cant reproduce in the ""traditional"" manner. That's one of their virtues in this society that encourages people to breed like rabbits, natural resources be damned.   And you're now telling me that this homosexual couple that is helping to keep the population down wants to adopt some of the population that was created and abandoned by heterosexual couples, and WE'RE DENYING THEM THAT?   Better no parents than good parents, is that it? If heterosexual couples were already adopting 100% of kids up for adoption then this ""who will they talk to about this issue and that issue"" bullshit might have a shred of credibility, but they don't.   I'm not adopted, but I bet its much easier to have the bird and the bees talk, for example, with an adoptive gay parent - of either gender, than it is to have that talk with the manager of the adoption facility.   I think gays have every bit the potential to be amazing parents that straights do. But seeing as how straight couples leave many children un-adopted, and seeing as how it's obvious you can be a horrible parent even when your ignorant little gender role is filled, i dont know why this issue even needs discussion.",p-no_threat_for_child,1,gr66arg2
