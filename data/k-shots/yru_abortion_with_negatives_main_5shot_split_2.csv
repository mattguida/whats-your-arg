ab206,"Take this hypothetical.   A woman, her child and a doctor are out hiking in no mans land and they have an accident (a fall lets say). The child is injured. He needs a blood transfusion and the mother and child are the same type (the doctor is not).   The doctor explains the risks to the mother - the child needs a lot of blood and he has no way to measure how much is being taken... there is a risk she will loose too much blood and die.  She agrees  He hooks her up, so she is supporting the childs life. After 10 minutes she is starting to feel lightheaded, and gets scared. She decides she doesn't want to do this anymore - she has 2 other children at home that need her.  Does she have the right to unhook herself? The child will surely die. Of course she does, it's legal, and nobody has ever tried to make it illegal. Even after agreeing, and being hooked up, she can change her mind.   So if a women gets pregnant, and the fetus is hooked up to her, why does she have to stay hooked up? At some point between her and the fetus the umbilical is part of her body. Does she not have the right to disconnect it if she feels she is not up to going through with it?  Why would a women be legally required to keep her fetus alive by allowing it access to her body, but has no legal requirement that she keep her child alive after it is born (even if there is 0 risk to her life)? A women has a right to not have her body used by someone else.",c-sex,0,ab206arg12
ab65,How many times is this topic going to be posted?   The same asshole Materialists come on here and spread their filth.  Abortion IS murder people there is no denying that and you can't prove its not.  I stand by that.,c-kill,1,ab65arg10
ab33,"NO. Of course I do not agree with abortion. It is murder, and there is no way around it. Did you know there is a law that you go to jail if you hurt a lady that makes her loose her baby, but not to kill it on purpose in abortion. Now does that make sense?",p-mother_danger,0,ab33arg3
ab85,"Abortion became legal in America in the 1800s and was banned -became illegal - when Americans got their consciences back through a spiritual revival across the nation.   What's funny is that the number of abortions performed were higher when abortion was illegal than when it was legal, and since Roe vs Wade, abortions have continually decreased, especially since the 80s. And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.   At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.   At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells. Depending on the week or trimester, a zygote is not alive--can't even respond to stimuli, and therefore cannot be murdered or killed.   But when you consider that most people have children and their children have children, it opens a whole nother door regarding the massiveness of just one act of abortion.   No, it doesn't. A zygote isn't a ""class of people"", it isn't even a person yet. There are more murders   My position is that abortion is unconscionable and should forever be banned and illegal.   So? Unconscionable doesn't mean it should be made illegal.",p-not_human,1,ab85arg2
