ab145,"I support what you say...but I would add this....when a child is concieved...there is nothing potential about it. It is already a living human being.  And I would ask you to think about the rape and incest clause in your position.  Let me ask you this.........if you believe a human life starts at conception, how is death right for even a child of rape? If you walked into a nursery full of babies and the nurse told you that one out of the twentys mother was raped...would you be able to pick that child out? Life is life and although rape is a violent act...so is abortion. So rape is the first wrong....and then on top of that abortion is another. The woman can live with two crimes. That is the same as incest. If you are pro life that means you value ALL LIFE, not just some.  If you are pro-choice and think that abortion should be legal even though you think its gruesome and wrong.....then you are not pro-life. Being pro-life is being against abortion period...unless the woman is dying on the table...and then in most cases both can be saved.",p-not_human,0,ab145arg2
ab64,"[What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts]  I believe Avasked said mistreatment counted as cruelty. Last I checked, mistreating someone includes murder and rape. Cruelty must involving hurting someone, physically or mentally. The fetus cannot think nor can feel.",p-not_human,1,ab64arg2
ab252,--------------------------------------- &gt;  That is soo true living with the guilt forever know you murder you child it would have been even better if the murder hadn't been born.,p-not_murder,0,ab252arg6
ab233,"Abortion isn't killing babies like most people think. A fetus in the early stages of development is really just a soup of cells lumped together in one spot. It doesn't have the ability to think or feel pain as it doesn't have a brain yet.   Sometimes abortion would be the best option for the mother. If a woman had been raped and got pregnant as a result of that, she has all the right to abort if she wants to. If a woman doesn't have the economic resources to support the child, abortion is also an option. Sure, some people say adoption but a lot of kids spend their whole lives in a shelter because nobody adopted them. Can you imagine how much mental pain they go through? How much they've suffered? If this situation is bound to happen, the best option would be to abort the unborn fetus before it has the capability of suffering.",p-rape,1,ab233arg1
