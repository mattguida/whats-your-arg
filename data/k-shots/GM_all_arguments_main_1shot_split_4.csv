48arg1,"I am a homosexual and honestly LOVE IS LOVE and why can't I live with my girlfriend ? So why can't I have a little paper that says I am married to the girl I love? Either way gays will be around and they will live and act like a married couple or go some where else .  And we we can reperdouce ,  by artfical or adoption and raise a child.  SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE GAY atleast they are happy , arent you? Either way population will grow , and if a child gets raised in a homosexual house hold, who is anyone to say its worse then living in a crack house or an abusive house ?  Gay Marrige is a postitive thing our world could use , gay people can raise a child BETTER then a father-mother household. A normal household parents are abusing their child and on dugs. LOVE IS LOVE why should people have to hide who they are to be normal Nobody is NORMAL if they where the world whouldn't be the shi whole it isand we wouldnt be at war. Why deny someone to have it say on paper their married? Either way gays will be around and will live and be togther as a married couple.",Gay couples can declare their union without resort to marriage,3
