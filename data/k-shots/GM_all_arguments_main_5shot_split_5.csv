193arg5,"one of the main reasons that gay marriage isn't legal is because of religious views, however government and religion are meant to be SEPARATE!!",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
151arg7,"The only purpose of marriage in the eyes of the law is to establish legal kinship where none existed previously. ALL else is personal.  This negates the false 'it will lead to polygamy' slippery slope meme, and also the 'should a man be allowed to marry his daughter' nonsense. It also negates the ' it's like a man marryin' a dog/table/rock' idiocies, since none of these (non-humans) can give legal consent to enter into a marriage contract.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,2
69arg5,"I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.  Plain and simple, heterosexual marriage is the safest way to engage in sexuality and everything else is risky behavior and there should not be laws protecting it.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,3
87arg7,Im against same sex marriages.  It is the way I was raised and that I have grown up believing is correct.  They cannot reproduce and I feel they or it encourages more wrong in our society.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4
26arg2,"Gay marriage is different from that of interracial marriage which was also banned at one point in that nobody chooses to be black or white, yet a person chooses to be gay.  Homosexual activity is unnatural and leaves no possibility to creation of children.  The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.  I'm all for giving them benefits, but not for including their unionization into the sacred definition of marriage.  This way we will be able to distinguish from our children the difference of a civil union and marriage as believed to be by most christianity.",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,5
