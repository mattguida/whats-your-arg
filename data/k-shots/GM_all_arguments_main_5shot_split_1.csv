5arg5,"A lot of the comments I see on the right have to do with it not being right or going against the Bible. Since when are we a theocracy? Freedom of religion, people! Even going along with the Bible thing, it also sanctioned farmers selling their daughters as slaves. Should that be practiced, too, then? The Bible does not run our laws and government. One more thing: when the South was just becoming desegregated, many were against it. They said that it just wasn't right to be using the same facilities as blacks. Is this not the same thing? Just because we're brought up to believe that it's wrong doesn't mean it is wrong.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,1
175arg4,"first let me say that our government should make no laws for nor against our bedroom preferences. This should never be a legal matter. I will soon be celebrating the 25th year of my SACRED wedding vows. Gay marrige is NOT sacerd.   Marriage is an institution for building families, and not for the soul purpose of tax credits or bed room choices.Ggay marriage is no more legitement than a pedifile wanting to marry a 10 yr. boy.

If you choose to be gay thats fine with me, Just don`t belittle my 24 yr wedding vows by forcing your opions on me.",It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,2
108arg2,"Marriage is for heterosexuals.  Other contractual instruments are available or could be legislated to give obligations and rights to partners.  Why infringe on marriage as a tradition?  If so, why not permit polygomy?  How far do you go?",Gay couples should be able to take advantage of the fiscal and legal benefits of marriage,4
161arg4,Those who are gay deserve all the rights of those who are straight. No person should ever be told that they can't be with the person they love because of something they can't change.  We are all equals. To take away a person's rights is unfair and wrong.,It is discriminatory to refuse gay couples the right to marry,5
198arg5,"yeh i have a comment, the bible says that homosexuals are a abomination. now a bunch of f**s want me to disagree with god. aint gonna happen. be all the f** you want to be, but i refuse to go against god almighty, and tell him that his rules are wrong because a bunch of f**s want to satisfy there emoral sexual urges. god has left his rules to live by. and your breaking them.",Major world religions are against gay marriages,4
