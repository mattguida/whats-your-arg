oba393,"I would ask anyone who supports him to name something that he has done that will do anything to help the United States.   Lily Ledbetter, START treaty, the repeal of DADT, Consumer Protection legislation, he increased the Veterans Administration budget to hire and train health professionals for military personnel, funded the violence against women act, the land and water conservation fund, the CDBG, to name a few.   Our country is in worse shape that when he was elected and the fact that he is backing down on virtually all of his promises and policies should tell you something isn't working.   First, what do you mean by worse shape? And of the criteria, that you use to establish this ""worse shape"", how much of it can Obama be legitimately blamed for?  Second, Obama has kept just under 130 (an additional 40 kept with compromise) (and just under 230 in the works) of his ~500 recorded campaign promises in the first two full years of his Presidency. That's not such a horrible pace that we should all abhor his legislative and other Presidential activities. But what promises did he break and what policies has he backed down from that you would have really liked to see him keep?   We don't need progress. We need principles.   A completely nebulous and possibly useless slogan.",p-foreign_policies,1,oba393arg6

oba273,"Obama has done in 30 days what bush did in 8 years! Bush promised after 9/11 that we would never get attacked again ,did we get attacked?, no! Obama HAS NOT help save the economy in any shape or form he made it even worse . do you call over thousands of troops DIEING everyday waiting for obama to send or bring back troops ,you call that, ''BANNING TORTURE?''And no he has not begun withdrawing troops from Iraq. The only good thing to happen with him i for him to be impeached,and get Huckabee or McCain in office! We need to get OUR country back!!",c-economy,1,oba273arg9
