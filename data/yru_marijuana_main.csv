ma105,"No, I've had first hand experience of what it's like to be around people smoking marijuana. It's a bad pungent odor that can be smelled several yards away. I mean when you can smell someone smoking marijuana from down the street, it's a social issue. In time even the smell gives me a bad headache. Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern. I know, I know, Marijuana only alters the mind and it has no harmful fumes, yeah, well, wait until it goes public and it's everywhere, I think we'll find, as we do with almost everything, it's not what we assumed it would be. We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol. Some of us are while many others of us are not, and really, to legalize marijuana would mean a whole new era of legislation to control everyone that would not regard others in their use of the substance. At least now, they have to regard others or risk having the police called on them.",c-health,"imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.",ma105arg0

I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.

I'm fine if you use marijuana because your doctor prescribes it to you, however most of the time, that is not the case and Marijuana is abused by many teens and young adults. There is a reason the future of America (and the world) is going downhill. The increased Marijuana use in high school and middle schoolers is one of the main reasons.",c-addiction,"it still only slows down, does not cure the medical issue.",ma171arg5

ma176,"I have to disagree with your comparison of marijuana to alcohol in some respects. Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant.

If it was legalized, and you could only get it from your doctor, then it would be easy to detect addiction and the doctor could refuse to give you any.   If it was legalized, then there would be no dodgy characters entering my block of flats to sell not only pot but the whole array of harder drugs.  If it was legalized, some of the money that pothead is paying could be used to benefit the rest of us in taxes, and not only a small group of criminal barons.   But, alas, it is illegal... so now I have to put up with skunk smell and shadows creeping in the night to sell it.",p-legal,"If it was legalized, some of the money that pothead is paying could be used to benefit the rest of us in taxes, and not only a small group of criminal barons.",ma367arg1

ma427,"I think the biggest reason that marijuana is illegal is a cultural one. If you've never smoked it, it's hard to describe how it makes you feel. The best way I can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. It slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. This leads me to my next part. It's going to require a leap, so follow me. The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, ""Do I really need that many THINGS?"", ""Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a ""boss""?"" ""Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?"" ""Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?""  There are other reasons that marijuana should be legal or at least decriminalized, but I believe this is the biggest obstacle: We might actually wake up and analyze what our lives are, what consequences our behaviors have on ourselves, our neighbors, and the rest of the world.

ma65,"Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.

ma77,"societys prohibition in 1937, extract of Cannabis sativa (marijuana) was one of the top three most prescribed medicines in the US. When it became illegal, its use as a medicine became restricted. Despite these regulations research on the medical use of marijuana continued. I have read this article it's so interesting there are many thing why cannabis shouldn't be legalize  http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/ addiction/issues/marijuana.html     One thing I learned is that marijuana does relieve pain and that it is not nearly as addictive as morphine. It can ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and, at the same time, give you a wonderful high.  Despite the positives, I am not convinced. There are so many other factors that need to be considered. Marijuana causes some parts of the brain - such as those governing the emotions, memory and judgment - to spin out of control.If you choose to ignore the attacks and memory loss, consider what marijuana can do to your lungs. Its smoke carries more tar and other particles than tobacco. You can relieve your migraine, but you also have a higher chance of developing lung cancer.To drug policy reformers, prohibition of marijuana is not just a cause to be supported, but a mandatory way of life, necessary to uphold societyâs moral fiber.
