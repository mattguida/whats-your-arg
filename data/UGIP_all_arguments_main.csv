The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.

414721990arg1,"The phrase 'under God' acts as a limit on what is otherwise an unlimited promise of allegiance to a state. Without 'under God' the pledge becomes a promise to support whatever the current policies of the government are. With 'under God' included, I can comfortably recite the pledge knowing that when the government adopts some policy that is contrary to the 'Laws of Nature and of Nature's God' I can reject the policy without breaking my promise. Unlimited allegiance to a state is not a good thing, as the historic examples of World War II show us. The United States is not guiltless on this score either. In my own life the government has carried laws on the books that were unfair to blacks, to women, to the native inhabitants of this continent. Our current policy on interrogation by torture of supposed enemy combatants seems to be another example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The greatest danger to the exercise of any freedom, religious or otherwise, is the unchecked power of the organized state.
