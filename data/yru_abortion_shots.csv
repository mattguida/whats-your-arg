ab152,"When does life start? That is the question. This debate will be over in a matter of minutes if someone came up with the answer right now.  Evangelists would believe it starts at contraception while scientists debate that it is more accurately the development of the brain which is the seventh week of development.   Of course any right minded person wouldn't put the science of birth in the hands of someone with no scientific expertise so it is generally accepted that the 7th is the week that a clump of cells turn into human.  However how can any scientist or evangelist understand when a child gains a soul as the question is purely philosophical?  The soul has been deemed integral or essential to consciousness, personality and every free thinking person has a soul which defines his existence as a human being rather than an imamate object.   Plato says that a soul is a combination of various aspects. Mind, reason, emotion, appetite and desire. These characteristics define a soul. According to Platoan philosophy, if you were void of one of these aspects you are without soul.  -An unborn child has a mind which allows it to make functional processes in its body but is not capable of and thought. Thought encompasses things such as imagination, ideas and reflection. A lot of people say dreams are proof of an unborn childâs thought but dreams donât count because they are instinctive of a human slumber. It forces the brain to stay asleep as an inactive brain causes your brain to disable processing information from nervous system and other systems. This could ultimately cause you to loose consciousness all together so an automatic reaction is to wake up, itâs like a screensaver.   -An unborn child has no reason; it has no choices to create over itself. No study has shown that an unborn child has ever been able to conduct its own decisions rather than its own instinctive actions.  -It has no emotion, no joy, sadness or pity. (For all your religious nuts out there, pain is not an emotion)  -Appetite is only created through its instinct to survive, I suppose it counts.  -Unborn children have no desire. They do not want anything but their instinct to, live, eat, and kick stomach every now and then. There is no aspiration or defining motive.   If anyone has any counters against these points I would like to hear what you have to say. However I do believe this is an erudite explanation of the creation of ones consciousness from a philosophical standpoint. When an unborn child gains all these aspects it moves from inanimate object to living, breathing, free-thinking human being.

ab168,"Murder is a legal definition. It is the unlawful killing of another human being. Thus Abortion is not Murder. Shooting a burglar is ""taking someone's life without permission"" however that is not murder either.   The right to bodily sovereignty should be absolute. What right is more basic that control over our own body. You have the right not have an operation, or medical care or drugs. You also have the right not to forcible donate blood, or organs, or risk your life to save another.   All pregnancy carries risks to life and health, the fetus uses the mother's blood and organs. She has a right to stop their use. Can she abort in the 9th month? No, but she should have the right to evict. She has control of HER body, not the fetuses.",p-not_murder,She has a right to stop their use.,ab168arg1
ab185,"In my opinion it is wrong, because you kill a baby, even if he was not born. We have to save lives, but not to kill them. Also, it is inmoral according to philosophy. In addition, it harms to the health of woman. Even in future this woman cannot have any babies.",c-kill,it is inmoral according to philosophy,ab185arg1
ab241,"WOMEN CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL THEY'D LIKE TO DO WITH THEIR OWN BODIES.   Then maybe they should make better choices with regards to birth control. It's their fault they're pregnant. And don't give me that rape argument, only 1% of abortions happen because of rape.",c-sex,Then maybe they should make better choices with regards to birth control.

ab32,"Ok, the problem with jstantall is his belief system is clouding all of his arguments.  First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.   Secondly, we don't even need an excuse to get rid of a fetus if we don't want it. It's not as if the world's population is dwindling, we actually don't need any more unwanted babies coming into this world! We've got enough of the babies that are actually wanted and we also have enough of those who aren't wanted and have become a burden on society because of their natural tendencies to commit crimes, so if you want to save actual lives and not potential lives, then make wars illegal, make climbing Mt. Everest illegal, make motor racing illegal.",p-not_human,"First of all, the fetus is only a potential life and is no comparison to the actual life that is the mother.",ab32arg0
