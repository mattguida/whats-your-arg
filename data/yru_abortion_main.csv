To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy. They say the happiest people live in poorer countries. You have no right to tell someone that they dont have a right to live. Funny your saying that....and you were born. LOL Is your life perfect?

He states, ""It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermaozoan and the resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual.""   Dr. Keith Moore's text on embryology, referring to the single-cell zygote says, ""The cell results from fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm and is the beginning of a human being. He also states, ""Each of us stated life as a cell called a zygote.""  Dr. Keith Moore, the Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 2d ed. (Philadelphia, Penn)  J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics (New York : McGraw Hill) In their work on biology and obstetrics, state, âThe zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life.â?  Dr. Louis Fridhandler, in the medical textbook âGametogenesis to Implantation Biology of Gestation,â? vol.1, ed. N.S. Assau (New York: Academic Press) refers to fertilization as âthat wondrous moment that marks the beginning of life for a new unique individual.â?    Doctors, E.L. Potter and J.M Craig write in Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed.

These doctors tesified before a United States Senate Committee on life.   Dr. Alfred Bongioanni, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.  He said, âI have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human lifeâ¦.I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of pubertyâ¦.is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.â?  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He saysâ? after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.â?  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: âBy all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.â?

Is the innocent child in the wombs life less than one in a womb who got there by a mother who was not raped?

ab121,"[In my point of view, abortion shouldn't be banned. Abortion is a not bad thing for women, especially for teenagers. Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong, but most of those people even haven't been pregnant. It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion, but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice.   When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Abortion is not very good, of course. But it is not wrong. It is a choice. It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant. You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do? Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong? I don't think so. You would think, even for a minute you would think about abortion.  What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Abortion is a murder. I agree with that. But everybody has a right to be wrong. Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it. We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion. As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.  How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   So, I can say that all of us make mistakes, we are not perfect. Nobody does. But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes.   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.  But if woman decided not to have a child, it is not wrong.  It is not good, but not wrong.]",p-right,It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.,ab121arg0

Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pigâ¦to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ¦when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ¦  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from Godâ¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the worldâ¦.and I have faith in Himâ¦.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfectâ¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ¦and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matterâ¦..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why donât you do some heavy research on thisâ¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it Iâm afraid. The man does not have to assume squatâ¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sexâ¦.blah blahâ¦â¦..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you donât want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell meâ¦â¦Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnât believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we canât change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changedâ¦.and I am allowed to change my mindâ¦..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What youâre saying hereâ¦.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I donât have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ¦.. but then youâre perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistakeâ¦.if you have children donât you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ¦.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participatedâ¦â¦good should have overcome evil, but didnât.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness donât. I was not a child when I had itâ¦.   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MANâ¦.and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think itâs horrendousâ¦Anyone who does not see one and think itâs horrendousâ¦is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. Itâs not selfishâ¦its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking youâre not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watchâ¦shows. Thatâs what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murderâ¦.I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. Andâ¦.you are judging meâ¦   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you donât believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ¦.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I workâ¦.I live a full life and when I get on hereâ¦.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper â¦.it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ¦.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I knowâ¦   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldviewâ¦and explains what I said all alongâ¦why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your postâ¦â¦â¦â¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canât. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Nawâ¦you donât.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.",p-right,it's the woman's decision,ab126arg0
ab126,"Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married   Even if they are married it's the woman's decision still so this has no validity.   Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pigâ¦to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ¦when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ¦  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from Godâ¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the worldâ¦.and I have faith in Himâ¦.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfectâ¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ¦and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matterâ¦..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why donât you do some heavy research on thisâ¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it Iâm afraid. The man does not have to assume squatâ¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sexâ¦.blah blahâ¦â¦..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you donât want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell meâ¦â¦Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnât believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we canât change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changedâ¦.and I am allowed to change my mindâ¦..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What youâre saying hereâ¦.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I donât have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ¦.. but then youâre perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistakeâ¦.if you have children donât you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ¦.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participatedâ¦â¦good should have overcome evil, but didnât.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness donât. I was not a child when I had itâ¦.   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MANâ¦.and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think itâs horrendousâ¦Anyone who does not see one and think itâs horrendousâ¦is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. Itâs not selfishâ¦its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking youâre not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watchâ¦shows. Thatâs what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murderâ¦.I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. Andâ¦.you are judging meâ¦   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you donât believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ¦.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I workâ¦.I live a full life and when I get on hereâ¦.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper â¦.it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ¦.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I knowâ¦   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldviewâ¦and explains what I said all alongâ¦why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.

I don't sit the fence, I say the radical opinions are idiotic, and it's foolish to not think they are. To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.   Why do I say that?

ab186,"""This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.""   A mammalian cell, if processed to revert it back to totipotency, will grow into a zygote, and then a full human. This is like asexual reproduction. Your line of reasoning is flawed.  Now you just defined the concept of human life to include an unthinking mass of tissue cells. That cheapens what it means to be human.   ""This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.""   Consequences of a truth do not make the truth any less correct. Humans are defined by their ability to think, reason, and learn; they are defined by a culture spanning tens of thousands of years. Homo sapiens sapiens is defined by genetic relationship. Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).   ""What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.""   You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.   ""You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.""   Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.   ""The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference. ""   You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life.   ""Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.""   I ignore it because it has no rights. It isn't human. If you can't understand why a mass of cells smaller than a skin flake without a brain isn't human, then I suggest you stop arguing and read some college-level biology textbooks. You need a biology education.  But we're hovering around why you believe it is human, actually. This is probably a religious matter for you, not grounded in evidence, or logic.   ""And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.""   It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born. Stop using language that is categorically wrong in order to try and tie together a poor argument.   ""When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).""   I could argue that my religion treats as matter of faith that sperm has souls in all the cells, and that spilling sperm wastefully is murdering all those souls. I could them take up a moral platform with my church and crusade across the country trying to get masturbation banned along with pornography, and sex education.  The point to take from this is that these issues are rooted in dogma that cannot be argued away. Science already provides some clear-cut information that could be used to answer the question of whether a fetus or zygote is alive or should be properly construed as human in a legal context. Dogmatic people insist upon having beliefs however, with no evidence to support themselves beyond the emotional and intuitive appeal of their arguments.  You are the one here that is making a claim that is just assumed to be true, with no room for negotiation. You insist upon having beliefs instead of knowledge, and that is why I ridicule you.",p-not_human,"It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born.",ab186arg0

ab19,"I said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. But even rape has neutrality in it. Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler, a murderer of innocent people. Is that evil? No. Fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral.   There is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. You can't, I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you.  It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? No. And yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. Have you no imagination? Here's a scenario: You are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. Is that love wrong? Just because there is an age gap? Not necessarily. Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are.   What Hitler did WAS wrong, did I dispute that it wasn't? But in fact, it was gray in some areas. Why? Because he saved Germany. He did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil.  The 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. Yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. Even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil.  It's meant to be contradictory. I don't believe in either radical, I trust in the balance between the two which I explained. Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time? I'm not pro-choice, I'm just on this side of the debate. The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point.  Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Also, yes, I am God. I am a Pantheist. But that has nothing to do with this debate.  If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist. Duh.  No, I am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. The point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human.  Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. So no, I am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean.  Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. Though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense.

A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.

ab24,"Ok what about women who are raped? This is a violent act for sure. But are two acts of violence better than one? I think abortion is a a violent way to kill a living human being. It is not given a sedative...it is ripped, burned and dismembered while the heart beats, when it quite possibly is moving. So how is the act of rape the new living childs fault? If you walked into a nursery in a hospital and the nurse told you that one out of the ten babies theres mother was raped...do you think you could pick it out? No....it has just as much right to life as the child whose mother was not raped. The mother who was raped not only will remember the rape, but the day she...took it upon herself to kill another living person. So if you value life........you value all life and you give it a chance.   You bring up the death penalty.....I am not pro-death penalty...I do believe in prison however...and not prisons with television, internet, and work out rooms.   I did give proof some of the top doctors around the world, researchers...I mean what more do you want? Many of these doctors testified in front of the Senate on when life begins.   And your last question.....  I believe that women know when they have sex they might become pregnant, even if they take precautions. I believe that when a life is started...that that life should be allowed to be born. Nine months is not that long when you know it can save another living persons life. There is always adoption. What is nine months...compared to killing?   This is about doing what is right, not only for the woman but the life growing inside her...that she help start.

ab256,"You said, âTell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.â?  It takes two, the woman canât conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are marriedâ¦does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they takeâ¦then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, âAnswer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.â?  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesnât want to be involved. Exampleâ¦..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trialâ¦..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She didâ¦because whether reckless sex happened or notâ¦the risk she took didnât pan outâ¦.she got pregnantâ¦.and where is the dad???????  You said, âIf the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?â?  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, âHere's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?â?   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings â  You also said, âYou deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.â?  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pigâ¦to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a styâ¦â¦â¦LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debatesâ¦when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignoranceâ¦go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take itâ¦roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your postsâ¦and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like itâs a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matterâ¦..but will leave it with these two. Why donât you do some heavy research on thisâ¦not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, âYou said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?â?  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, âIt got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. âThis is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.â?  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it Iâm afraid. The man does not have to assume squatâ¦unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes offâ¦knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman?  You said, âAn unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, âThe man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.â?  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the basesâ¦have not scored a grand slamâ¦ and she says noâ¦â¦..itâs no, you canât come in. If he does against her wishes itâs rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it wonât affect him in the leastâ¦..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     âHow, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.â?  It does take a man and a woman to procreateâ¦which is why I also am against same sex unions, itâs not naturalâ¦but thatâs another debate. They both have sexâ¦.blah blahâ¦â¦..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same pageâ¦.but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, âSeriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you donât want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, âI'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.â?  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell meâ¦â¦Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didnât believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we canât change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changedâ¦.and I am allowed to change my mindâ¦..are you?   When you make a huge mistakeâ¦.if you have children donât you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What youâre saying hereâ¦.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I donât have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogantâ¦.. but then youâre perfect remember?   âIn a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.â?  Oh my goodness donât. I was not a child when I had itâ¦.I should have known betterâ¦and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didnât care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MANâ¦.and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witnessâ¦to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same pageâ¦until laterâ¦when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didnât. Worldviews changeâ¦.and mine did drastically. We have adjustedâ¦and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, âI have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?â?  Distraught about what? Tell meâ¦.how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala tripâ¦.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I donât get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think itâs horrendousâ¦is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch thisâ¦â¦..and if you donât, think about the reasons why you wonât. Search your heartâ¦about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have childrenâ¦.put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     âI'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.â?  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldnât tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. Itâs not selfishâ¦its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? Itâs the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, âYou are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, âNot pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.â?  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking youâre not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watchâ¦shows. Thatâs what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  âWhat has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.â?  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothingâ¦.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participatedâ¦â¦good should have overcome evil, but didnât. People act out of fearâ¦.and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDNâT DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIMâ¦I am talking about the people in his own countryâ¦.the people who could have physically taken himoutâ¦.the guards, etc.   Abortion is like thatâ¦.people sit by and do nothingâ¦.they think anything they doâ¦.wonât change the laws, wonât help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortionâ¦.if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and goodâ¦â¦.abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortionâ¦.wowâ¦.how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from Godâ¦and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheistsâ¦.so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evilâ¦â¦â¦..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, âAgain what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.â?  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thingâ¦â¦..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to noneâ¦â¦but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, âI sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.â?  You condone murderâ¦.I never called you a racist.     You said, âI don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?â?  I never use violent adjectives on youâ¦.you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classlessâ¦  .  âI didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.â?  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if youâre wrongâ¦you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with themâ¦..being with family etcâ¦would be just a tad bit goodâ¦you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you canât find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not goâ¦that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the worldâ¦.and I have faith in Himâ¦.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfectâ¦.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  âYou name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?â?  Itâs funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. Andâ¦.you are judging meâ¦I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heartâ¦.I canât, scripture does not allow me to do thatâ¦not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you donât know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done thatâ¦I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you donât believe in? LOL  You said, âNo I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.â?  You donât believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, âI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â?  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion periodâ¦.live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, âWhy because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words.

I am not however handing my posts in to be gradedâ¦.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation.

You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemieâ¦.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I knowâ¦.  âI don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.câ?  This is your worldviewâ¦and explains what I said all alongâ¦why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, âWhat do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?â?  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the worldâ¦â¦its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the lawâ¦just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your postâ¦â¦â¦â¦you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeksâ¦.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Canât let this one goâ¦â¦your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlierâ¦ You said, âI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.â?  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel painâ¦.or 24 weeks when obviously it canât. LOL  You do not even know your own position.

ab281,"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.   Had the fetus not been terminated, it could've had so much potential. It would grow up to be a child. It would get to listen to music, smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow. Everything we take for granted in life and life itself, is taken from the fetus.   Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore, it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion. In the same sense, is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life? Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness. This argument is irrational and morally incorrect.  What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision. The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live. It is not her choice to make. It is no one's choice to make. No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life. Imagine the world without you, because your mother had an abortion. You would never live all of your experiences. You would never have emotions. You would've never existed. Such is the travesty of abortion. Over a million lives, of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years, would never be lived.  Rape, sadly does happen. But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem. If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself. Harsher penalities, stricter monitoring policies, promoting rape whistles, reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this. Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible, but we can get this number a lot lower.   Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives. Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences.  Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone.

So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.   In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.   So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas.

A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways.

ab292,"You do not get the point.  Laws are mutable...subject to change...and it varies...region to region...state to state...nation to nation.  Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   If the law changes, it still doesn't change that birth is a distinct and unambiguous process separating the foetus from the newborn (also, I am aware of cesarean section, I still consider this birthing).  In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word ""unique"" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome.

ab293,"While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person. Sure, the starving and innocent in South America deserve support, but first we need to get our country better off so that we can afford the massive donations to infrastructure.",p-right,"Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person.",ab293arg0

When that fetus begins to respond to its environment in a way that environmentally expresses its genes to be different than that of what is found in the mother and the father, it is entitled to life. Most scientists believe this occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy, which isn't the best time to have an abortion anyways. But before the fetus begins to respond to its environment like I mentioned, it is not an individual. It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.

ab327,"What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classificationsâsurgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-EvraÂ® birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRingÂ® vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-ProveraÂ® Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan BÂ® is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",c-kill,Ending a life isn't cruel?,ab327arg0

So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.

ab35,"So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, ""The Embryo as a Transplant"" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.

Most women will not have abortions using this procedure, and their fetuses will not look at all like that. They probably will not even be recognizably human. If a woman went to a clinic, she would at least be told the truth about what would happen to her if she wanted an abortion.  However, D&E;is still in use today although it counts for a small fraction of all procedures. Abortions aren't pretty, no matter how they're done.

ab371,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM. He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......itâs NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said itâs unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, âIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.â?  Am I calling names? Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crassâ¦sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blameâ¦â¦and blame you do, for what is a womanâs issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortionsâ¦.because I know what itâs like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess whatâ¦â¦â¦..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted onâ¦â¦âYou are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.â?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robberyâ¦.and they are caughtâ¦.does the police just sayâ¦.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didnât show up, the nurse refuse to do itâ¦the baby might have a chance.   You said, â Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.â?  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isnât that what itâs all about, you said so yourself didnât you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,â Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.â?  I said, if a woman and man are marriedâ¦â¦he cannot stop her from killing their child by abortion. He has no rights even though it is his child. BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she canât hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificateâ¦and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, âWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issueâ¦.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  âIf I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?""

And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.  You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved) but that it shouldnt be her responsiblity only........(what the man should pay for the killing?) you think when the baby can feel pain abortion should not be allowed.... not allowed...after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.  I know the studies...I know people who have done the studies. The fact is....that which is in the womb is human, is alive and is a growing person. Science is on the side of life and defines it in terms that are not pro-choice.

ab379,"How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active. It often leads to malnutrition, anemia, or high blood pressure, and even when it doesn't do any of these things, it is still exhausting, painful, and their bodies will never be the same. This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",p-sick_mom,"Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active.

ab38,"Even though this argument contained a segment that invoked religion, I do respect it for supplying more than an endless stream of Bible verses and claims about what God wants or doesn't want.  1. If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not.

Either you are so young that you don't know better....or I just don't know, your ignorant about what responsiblity is   A woman gets pregnant a man gets her pregnant they BOTH take the risk. They are both equally responsible for a  pregnancy . I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.   It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man.   It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.   catticus....is there something wrong with abortion or not? You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called ""socially undesirable people""  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.  Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.   Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.   The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.",c-kill,I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being.,ab399arg0

According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised. And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus. How is this psssible if the fetus is a parasite? And how does the human body not fight against the fetus but rather undergo changes to accept the fetus?

ab438,"No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.

Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency.

Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it.

Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. ""Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection"" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",p-baby_ill_treatment,"The term ""human-being"" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency.

I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support.

No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.

Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.

ab455,"No my dear you do not obviously know the law. Our government says the child belongs to her, that she has the right to terminate the pregnancy WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM HIM   When did I say that wasn't the law. Do you read  anything  I type?    The fact is, the baby is hers at conceptionâ¦.she took the risk.   Tell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.    The sperm was a gift, he certainly canât ask for it back can he?   What? Answer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion.

Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.

At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus.

I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said itâs unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didnât you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reasonâ¦that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why donât you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still wonât change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAINâ¦â¦â¦.the man is an onlooker so says the lawâ¦.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Donât you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldnât he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortionâ¦this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what itâs like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So donât tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day backâ¦and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or notâ¦BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitlerâs ovensâ¦ pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliateâ¦you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   Youâre so ridiculous itâs not even funny. Bolongaâ¦many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond itâ¦.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliateâ¦.why are you judging me from different standards than you live byâ¦â¦â¦   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you donât like how I put thingsâ¦â¦..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.

Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out thereâ¦you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned.

ab7,"So on your view, then, it would be ok to kill these humans because they are not people?   The short answer is ""yes"", but the long answer would have to be ""no"".   What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as ""a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence."" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as ""Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc."" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between ""a rock and a hard place"" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a ""child"" nor a ""baby"". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother.

Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.

And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive?
