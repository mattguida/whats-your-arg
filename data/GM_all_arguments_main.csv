101arg1,"Legalizing gay marriage has nothing to do with the church, or it shouldn't. One part of marriage is getting benefits from the other. Many married couples never have children but still get the benefits of marriage, should we take those benefits away because they don't have children? Another is the promise to be with each other for an eternity etc. Marriage is also about being able to celebrate having each other. And last, marriage is about being there for each other. Granting marriage to same-sex couples lets them see eachother in hospitals, make medical desicions for their partner when they are unable to and ensure both of the participants safety. Everyone deserves the right to recive these things in a relationship.  And besides, not every wedding is in a church, plenty of atheists get married, should we ban marriage from them too for not being christian, muslim or jewish (or any other religion)? Contemplate that then look around you, look at your boyfriend/girlfriend and your relatives, some of them might be homosexual.

Non discrimination laws will require all treated equal and will force people into something they do not agree with. A church could be required to mary a gay couple even if they do not agree with it because denying to marry a gay couple would be considered discrimination. Gay marriage will destroy the already fragile balance between church and state and will ruin religious freedom entirely. Not only that but gay marriage can open doors for polygamy, incest, etc. to be considered marriage too, which is wrong.",Marriage should be between a man and a woman,4

152arg1,"The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.

34arg1,"Gay people do not have a disorder, rather we all are sinners, and some people struggle with different sins more than others. it is silly to say gay people can't get married because they can't have children. The only real argument against gay marriage is that it is unnatural as described in Romans 1:26-27 and at least three other verses. Yes, Christians are commanded to love, but not in a homosexual way. There's a difference between loving your girlfriend or boyfriend and loving people as stipulated in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Other less important arguments that can be made is that a homosexual relationship can be physically unhealthy, but smoking is unhealthy, and people still do that. Furthermore, the Bible does not say to avoid judging in Matthew 7:2-6, because it says to not cast your pearls before swine and such (please no one assume I'm saying that anybody is swine; I would not do that ever); showing that you must first determine who the swine are, but ultimately, God is the only one who should judge, because he is perfect. Bottom line, we all need Jesus! Nobody needs him more than another! God's word is truth!

Just because SOME (yes not all)  Christians believe it is wrong does not mean those beliefs can be enforced on this entire nation!!!!!  Also if marraige is really only important for procreation...then shoudn't infertile marraiges be illegal?  Yes ridicoulous!!  And If a child supposedely needs both a mother and a father to ever be successful in this world....then why don't we ban single parents??  And it's not like there are poor starving homeless children out there...or children in orphanages that need to be adopted......and it's not like children are being born every day...Everyone needs to procreate or they are useless and WE NEED more children.....Yes I'm the queen of sarcasm.  But really I hope for a day when this whole country wakes the heck up and allows people to marry whoever they love....seriously only 10% of people are gay so it's not like we would loose our population because of it.  Gay people deserve all the rights in this Free Country.  Being Gay Is NOT a choice.  No one would choose to have a life where you are constantly descriminated against just by being who you are and where you are denyed rights to marraige.,Marriage should be between a man and a woman,2

I will never agreed with the fact that gay couples adopting children, that is just wrong because those  children will not have the same childhood as normal kids. How about when they go to school and the teacher ask who are the parents he will be like oh! I got two moms or I got two dads. That its just not right because it has always been Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. The bible does not says that men should marry men or vice versa. It has always been clear to me that the word Marriage it's between Man and Woman. Gay couples can live their crazy and in moral life however they want but will not be allowed to get marry like a heterosexual couple. It is just disgusting seen a man kissing other man or a woman kissing other woman if front children.

85arg1,If we address gay marriage on the basis of religion then yes it is considered wrong. but fact is no two people are going to have the same identical beliefs. some would say there is no  god and others say there is.
