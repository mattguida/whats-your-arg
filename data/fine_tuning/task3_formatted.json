Considering all the problems we face I'd say he's doing pretty well.

    "context": "Oh Yea, there is something obvious that I forgot in my original point, or points:     Borrowing money. Borrowing money from people who print money and devalue their currency is just as bad a printing money. Actually it's worse, it' puts you in debt the your borrowers i.e. China. Only if every country is free of debt to another will they truly be free.   Just like there are casualties of ware over territory,security, goods and other things, now there is a different war over debt that may require casualties in the name of true freedom. Though these will not be as obvious as soldiers on the battlefeild. They will be the ones who die due to cuts in medical programs and welfare programs. Medicare, Medicaid, and social security are the biggest share of our debt and we keep borrowing money from countries with no working standards or conditions to avoid the inevitable. The pay out that will leave us all broke. When the elderly outnumber the people working to support them. Or better their bills outnumber the wages of those who support them.   Freedom comes at a cost. Only those who are willing to make the sacrifices will get it.   So far I see Obama is willing to make some sacrifices, but not the tough ones. Tough ones are required to climb out of the hole which we have dug. The borrowing has to stop. The printing has to stop. Or we will never get out.   I'm sorry that's just what logic dictates. Once again I ask... somebody own me on this... I want your best arguments seriously....",

    "context": "in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important.   Bill Clinton had a different view on things. It was about having taxes that can match the spending. However, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why Clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus.   My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me.   You're ignoring some of my points on a voucher program, but even so, it makes little sense to reward others for doing nothing. As well, as explained, government services provide a lot less to the public than private services. This is simply because pursuit of wealth increases overall wealth. People have more in Capitalistic countries than in Collectivist countries. This is what the USSR witnessed when they privatized more industries, and this was the BIGGEST realization for China as they went from Communist to practically Laissez-Faire economics.     Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality.   Socialistic policies do not increase the amount of goods and services available to people (unless you include Militaristic policies that have been the only historical instance where massive government spending has actually benefited the citizens in in their wants). Food and clean water supply goes up with private industries' efforts to make more money. Consumers want goods and services, private forces provide them.  If you're worried about the poor, a voucher program (that would cut down spending and regulation greatly) would benefit them far more than a public service. Vouchers would give them the ability to choose at little to no cost to themselves. However, socialistic policies of government services and regulation only make things harder for the poor.   Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   I've given my explanation on Scandanavia and PrayerFails has given a different but also effective one as well. Wealth equality doesn't mean jack shit if the overall wealth is still low.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform   The current Ryan plan is to appeal to the Mainstream Democrats who hated his voucher program for healthcare.   over-regulation is one of them   general regulation does this. Unless you mean regulation ONLY in rich neighborhoods...    The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.   It came from government incentives to \"look out for the poor\" who were actually the risky loans. It came from government taxes on businesses that didn't make these high risks.    Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   I feel that you completely ignored my points that regulators should have no say in any of the business of the banks, and that general government should give absolutely no rewards to banks for any reasons. No subsidies, no tax incentives, no regulation, no interest fondling, and no bail-outs. Government should view banks as another business and should have no concern for them. This will remove their power over all of us who depend greatly on government currency yet require private industries to provide us with this government provision.   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   Explain.   I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately.   Why? forgive me, but this may just be my issue with debate in general, when others look to their pastors and school teachers as experts on very complex issues (especially to justify the surrendering of liberty for the sake of security that has never been shown to exist or be successful).   but the commentary they provide is not worthless.   To you, maybe. To me, it is very worthless.",

But people aren't simply defined as Republicans or Democrats. His progressive policies would anger a large number of the huge conservative population in the US. I would be surprised if there was no a reaction should all of his policies be passed.   Ya, cause nobody wants change.   Change for the sake of change though, is that always a good thing? And again, conservatives, they don't.   There's actually nothing new about most of his policies.

His policies began the process of deteriotaton that Obama inherited. By the time Obama took office, the deed was done, and he was faced with something akin to being given command of the 'Titantic'. Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with. If you know anything about American politics, you realize, the President's power are limited, and dependent upon Congress. In other words, even if his policies were 'perfect', if Congress decided not to support them, they would go no where.  Perhaps the greatest argument' can be found not just in the political arena, but in the totality of the man. Agree or disagree with his actions, you have to give credit to the fact that he is a man who keeps his promises, and maintains integrity in both his personal and professional life That type of man is more likely to succeed for it takes integrity and committment to accomplsh worthy goals.

Because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality...  As for your list of \"accomplishments\" it was rather clever of you to use a link to another forums and by doing so hiding the fact that the list is from DailyKos.  I wish I could color code stuff, but bold will represent things that are nothing special or would have most likely been done by McCain and italics will represent something that should not be the government's job or something that is not even an accomplishment.   1. Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.  Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations. This will be no different. If nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great American President for this alone despite knee-jerk \"there's a monster in your closet\" reaction from the perpetually scared right.   I'm sure the free-riders in this country will love it and those who realize that we have no way to pay for it will hate.   4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  I oppose the war, but I'll give him credit for recent success.   And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending   Trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   See above.  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  I'll give him credit... though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay.   1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  Good.   1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB   McCain would have likely done something similar.   1.Ended media blackout on war casualties; reporting full information   Seeing as every tv station not named Fox is in the tank for him this is not much of accomplishment.   1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  Good.   1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act   Until what goes on behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve and Obama's negotiations with Unions and Democrats this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   Really? They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.  1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.  1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?   1.Reengaged in the agreements/talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions   More bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists.    1.Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   And now they like us more... so what?

Because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality...  As for your list of \"accomplishments\" it was rather clever of you to use a link to another forums and by doing so hiding the fact that the list is from DailyKos.  I wish I could color code stuff, but bold will represent things that are nothing special or would have most likely been done by McCain and italics will represent something that should not be the government's job or something that is not even an accomplishment.   1. Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.  Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations. This will be no different. If nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great American President for this alone despite knee-jerk \"there's a monster in your closet\" reaction from the perpetually scared right.   I'm sure the free-riders in this country will love it and those who realize that we have no way to pay for it will hate.   4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.  I oppose the war, but I'll give him credit for recent success.   And here's a list of things Obama has done, some may not agree with everything, but at least he isn't at Camp David or reading to Kindergartners on the tax payer's dime:   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending   Trying to make agencies more efficient is not a new concept.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   See above.  1.Instituted enforcement for equal pay for women  I'll give him credit... though if women are to except maternity leave then they ought to expect lesser pay.   1.Beginning the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq  Good.   1.Families of fallen soldiers have expenses covered to be on hand when the body arrives at Dover AFB   McCain would have likely done something similar.   1.Ended media blackout on war casualties; reporting full information   Seeing as every tv station not named Fox is in the tank for him this is not much of accomplishment.   1.Ended media blackout on covering the return of fallen soldiers to Dover AFB; the media is now permitted to do so pending adherence to respectful rules and approval of fallen soldier's family  Good.   1.The White House and federal government are respecting the Freedom of Information Act   Until what goes on behind closed doors with the Federal Reserve and Obama's negotiations with Unions and Democrats this is not much of an accomplishment.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   Really? They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.  1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.  1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?   1.Reengaged in the agreements/talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions   More bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists.    1.Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   And now they like us more... so what?

A new regulation can suddenly transform a profitable investment into an unprofitable one or render employees unproductive. This produces uncertainty with all its attendant economic ills.  Just because we have the worst portions of the market, and the worst portions of socialism in American healthcare, does not mean we need to go towards more socialism... These countries that you hold up as models, are more efficient than ours, but they are going away from generous social programs, because they are going broke...

Thats a week of doing nothing even though he had already been told prior to Katrina that the leevees would not hold.  The oil spill that is occuring right now however was not predicted and Obama was told by BP that it was not a serious problem and wasn't told that the leak was in fact serious until almost a week later.  Bottom Line: Obama didn't know, Bush didn't even care.  \"Actually, Bush was the one who passed the first bail outs and in 2003 he tried to regulate Fanny and Freddie but the Democrats blocked him.\"  The recession started around December of 2007 so Bush's bail outs didn't do shit.

Its not are fault if some girl decides to go and have unprotected sex and end up pregnant and want to have an abortion. They should have to still have the baby. They should not have other people pay for their bills because they are young and have no job, in that case they do not have the money to pay for it. Then it will raise peoples insurance to help pay for peoples hospital bills. Last but not least i believe marajuana should be legalized so that all these people wont be going to jail over stupid reasons and the police can focus on the more important things to stop in our neighborhoods.",

Even if we differ in defintions of debt, and money flow, it has the same effect to the argument.   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?   I brought it up to say that he was forced to pay more, it was mandatory.   But if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views   In the simplest of terms, an economic system is simply nothing more than a system of allocation of resources, goods, and services. Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. Leaving them open to abuse by the rich is not what I think should happen, and that is what Libertarians would do - leave everyone to the benefits, and abuse, that others put on them through trade.  I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule   Which evidence? I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes  (the last few paragraphs) .   It's about getting government away from the banks all together.   Just like Iceland did? The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession. Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement. They simply speculated, loaned out money, told everyone it was going fine, had massive rates of leverage, and then it all fell to shit.  So no, I don't agree that deregulating the banks is a good idea, either economically, or from a humanitarian sense (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   A terrible one.   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.  But in all honesty, I haven't read around it too much, and don't have time to do so now, however, it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.",

    "context": "yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard.   His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.   Less taxing means more debt.   But it is not spending, which actually creates debt. Taxing is unnecessary to continue spending. Government will spend as much as it wants and will tax people as much as they want. We can't just say \"increase taxes to reduce debt\" when the debt could have been avoided all together. Once again, it's a red herring.   it largely falls outside of his mandate   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?  Bill Clinton, however, signed welfare reform. This was a Federal act.   I like this part of them, but disagree with others   yet you're not specific on how their economics will hurt anyone. You've avoided pointing to specific, first saying \"welfare is necessary\" and then saying \"well, Obama has no control over welfare.\"  Now, economics may not be your strong suit (it was once something i hardly considered), but if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views, you should be more specific on what is wrong with them.   Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule, even though I already described how the Buffet rule is a \"red herring.\"   You wish to completely deregulate the banks?   It's about getting government away from the banks all together. The banks, how they currently operate, could not survive without government involvement. They rely on subsidies, standardized currency, human controlled inflation and regulation to keep themselves in power. Without it they would hold little power over our wealth and currency. Currently, the banks dictate most money powers. They will continue to dictate as long as government stays involved with the affairs of the banks. This isn't about letting the large trample the small, it's about removing the power-source for this monstrosity that government created in the first place. Big government is the problem here, not lack of it.   bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country.   A bank without government would NEED to operate in the interest of the consumers or else it will attract none. Currently people feel that they need banks. While the privatization of banks seemed like a good idea during the transitional period between Centralized and non-centralized banks, what ended up happening was government assisted greedy men. You can not expect the private sector to do what it does best if government is still involved, as it always has been. The banks are protected from competitive currency because they hold all currency rights. The banks are paid by governments to continue being banks, which removes most financial liability (especially when you're large enough to \"need\" a bailout). And the banks are encouraged by leaders (government bureaucrats like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to make poor decisions but given money to make up for those poor decisions. This isn't some magical imbecile who happens to be running a bank, this is a guy basically being given money to make poor decisions with all of our money. It was inevitable with government involvement, as Ron Paul accurately predicted.   Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common,   Not if you eliminate government involvement in the banking market.   I was simply using them as an example.   A terrible one.   I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.   I'm sure you do, people complain a lot. The importance is substance, though.",

I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  \"To me, money is fungible,\" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  \"It's a genuine paying back,\" White said. \"It does reduce the federal government's involvement.\" Still, he said, \"it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate\" with the U.S. government.   Source:   http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/ statements/2010/apr/27/ed-whitacre/ ceo-says-gm-has-repaid-government-loans-                                        full/    In other words, GM has given back money it doesn't need, with interest. Which is still a good sign.   All of which were created by bad government policy before.   Yeah, like the irresponsible deregulation of the housing and banking markets. When you repeal laws that prevent downright criminal business practices, this can have a detrimental effect. I don't share your faith, the private sector can fail, and history is our proof of this. If you allow multi-million dollar businesses to pilfer people of their savings and their homes, that is exactly what they will do and that is exactly what happened in 2008.",

A lot of the taxation is theft mentality is predicated on the notion that we (humans) are not primarily social beings. Most of what you do in the world is social activity - buying goods and services, owning property, etc... all things are allowed for and provided by a society of people, participation is a privilege and you tacitly comply with and assent to taxation merely by participating  The 'We' is the nation as a whole, the demand of the masses as expressed through voting and engaging in political discourse.   i definitely agree that prudent is open to opinion, this is where the 'We' comes in, the 'we' becomes the expression of the collective opinon  You have obviously been smoking the supply side theory insofar as you think that the middle class is allowed for by the wealthy. Tax policy and education policy is what allows for the creation of a middle class and jobs are created by the market. It is true that if the wealthy have all the money that jobs are created by them because they are the only ones who could invest, however, if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all the money, jobs are created by where money is invested. Middle class people can invest just as much as the wealthy, and do when given the opportunity to when tax policy is not skewed in favor of the wealthy. Just because a lot of money is in the hands of the wealthy, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that this is the fundamental nature of job creation, it is only the nature of job creation in an extremely stratified society. Extreme stratification also creates instability in the market because investment is based on the whim of a small number of individuals who have often, in the past, jumped ship and played with the markets toward their own personal gain (not that personal gain is a problem, it is only a problem when it is done by manipulation and with the known consequence of huge costs to other people.) This is why there are anti-trust laws and laws that prevent monopolies.   The he who serves best earns best notion is valid to a point, but national income is not a reflection of this, income and wealth is a reflection of the degree to which a few people control the means of production and maintain that order through a rationalised stratification. I am not against stratification, I just think that there needs to be an ameliorative taxation policy to prevent the various forms of desperation that are fundamental to capitalist systems.   You totally did write uber-sensitive  Some truth is subjective, some truth is objective, like this - it is objectively true that you are reading this right now. I would argue that truth that which is subjective is only opinion. subjectivity is dependent on perception, objectivity is about things that are true independent of perception even if they require a perceiver. Truth does exist independent of belief about what is true.  Afirmative action is not about putting african americans ahead of caucasion , it is about social justice, it is not fundamentally left, and is distinct from the notion of modern racism even though it relates to racial issues. modern racism is when you - believe racism is a thing of the past, - make associations about people based on their ethnicity or skin color that are not necessary links. it is racist because you are making judgements and acusations about people according to their skin color or ethnicity, this includes names and religions that are a persons cultuaral heritage.",

They speak against the validness of the article, and portray good arguments. Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   I'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession, I'm talking about the very necessities of his office. In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include \"other extensions of relief that were also set to expire.\" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that \"there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,\" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. \"That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,\" he said. \"And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.\"   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it \"helps\".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most. Reducing spending on social support, and taxation, increases inequality, and disproportionately affects the poor.",

I feel like most right wing economic ideas do not promote maximal aggregate demand and thus I question the right wing economic ideas with respect to their intelligence and justifiability with respect to economic evidence and modern economic theory.   progressive taxation inspires greater consumption from the group that consumes the greatest - The Middle Class. It is the best way to accelerate economic activity. As far as i am aware, Supply side economics (i.e. trickle down economics - right wing economics) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption.   Aggregate Demand is the combination of Consumptions, Investment, Govt. Spending, and Net Trade activity. As far as i know, the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group. The middle class invest and consume relative to their ability. Progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus, in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class (typically left wing, socialistic policies).   To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well. I question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity",

    "context": "It's more about the tyranny behind taxation.   While I don't disagree that taxes do need a justification (which I feel is there, but am currently unable to provide - only heard of Libertarianism a few months ago, I'll think of something), in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important.   This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil.   Is it not (somewhat) balanced out by the fact that the money is (mostly) spent on the people?   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government.   You don't get what I'm saying :( My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me. Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality. The value or number of dollars has little do with that.   As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically).   I disagree. I feel that taxes or no, in the globalized world we live in, economies of scale has such an advantage that they are able to push people out of business with ease. Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   Free markets is very far from corporatism.   I meant simply in the way that people spend money on goods or services that they wish to possess, and people offer them. I did not mean that corporatism encouraged the free market, or is in any way good.   It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform (as far as I am aware, feel free to call me out on that if I am wrong), but simply cuts people from government provision to save money.   A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I agree that this is a major problem, I have many complaints for the current government (Obama included, this started off as me defending his impact on debt), and over-regulation is one of them.   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a \"red herring.\"   There is much more to the tax debate than the Buffet Rule. Your article claimed that he was unable to raise taxes on the rich in anyway, pushing millionaires' taxes to 30% is only part of it.   Way to leave out the most important part.   The banks damage was done at that point, one bank went into voluntary administration before it was taken over. So no, I don't feel that the government was the cause of the crash, the high risk, over-leveraged, under-regulated banking bubble was the cause of the Icelandic crash.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.  Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please?   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers.   An economy is nothing but a system of allocation of resources to fulfill the needs and wants of society. I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately. I would not trust them to suggest an alternative system, just as I would never presume to do the same, but the commentary they provide is not worthless.",

First of all, Obama is supposed to spend more in a recession, government spending should counter the business cycle. Bush had no real reason to continue the deficit in the way that he should have, whilst Obama had the biggest recession in modern history. To get back to your original point, of how Obama has increased debt more than any other president, I was simply pointing out that it's hardly a fair comparison.  Second of all, Obama's tried to increase tax on the upper classes, and the corporations, and been blocked by Republicans. Again, it's hardly fair to call him 'the worst president ever' when the results you are using against him are not of his own making.  But, as I said originally, I don't think Obama deserves all of the love that he gets from the 'Left'/liberals/democrats, whatever you want to call them. He is currently the best of a bad lot. I remember looking through the official comparisons of the various candidates economic projections, and yes, it is true that Ron Pauls cut the deficit most quickly, and therefore debt, but it did so at the expense of the economy.

It is also through President Obama and his supporters that the health care bill, legislation to curb green house gases and improve the environment passes, preventing a second great depression by saving three large car manufacturers from going out of business and which would have possibly leave hundreds or thousands without jobs, and also passed the largest economic stimulus bill, bringing the war in Iraq to an end, thus saving the economy a lot of money and innocent lives from being taken, nuclear non-proliferation movement, repairing our image abroad, reversed George Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign organizations that allows abortion, lifted Bush's ban on embryonic stem cell research, implementation of education system reform, tobacco regulation, financial industry reformation, appointing two Supreme Court Justices. These are the presidential accomplishments achieved by Obama and these are proof that the president is determined to fullfill his promoses he had first made to the nation. Now, it is our turn to give him the chance he need to do so and give him some more time.",

If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration.   OK, I don't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just don't see this. Tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes, but we are in a massive recession, so tax revenue is down. Your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact. Ironically, your point only proves why the Bush tax cuts should be extended: by lowering taxes for certain income brackets, the govt tax revenue actually goes up.   2. Spending has actually been cut   No. Sure he cut the f-22 program, but the stimulus bill, health care, and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending. This is just not true. Sorry.   3. Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it   So if everyone else is doing it we should too?

If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration.   OK, I don't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just don't see this. Tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes, but we are in a massive recession, so tax revenue is down. Your statement is true but is a huge manipulation of fact. Ironically, your point only proves why the Bush tax cuts should be extended: by lowering taxes for certain income brackets, the govt tax revenue actually goes up.   2. Spending has actually been cut   No. Sure he cut the f-22 program, but the stimulus bill, health care, and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending. This is just not true.

When the representatives finish debating and come to some kind of concession, a bill will be proposed for legislation, voted on and the President  will then  review it, sign on or veto it for another round of debate.

    "context": "then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter?   It's more about the tyranny behind taxation. In the terrible shit-storm that government has created thus far, it is almost impossible to eliminate most taxes today. However, we should be progressing past the need for taxation all together. Create a new system dependent on proper justification for spending and taxation (if necessary).  The taxes today are irresponsible and incomprehensible by average Americans. Many people have to pay someone just so they don't accidentally miss any payments. The tax bracket is better now than it has been at times, but it is unrealistic. Taxes on Capital Gains are basically taxing the same income twice.  Taxes for subsidizing wheat and corn, and products made by wheat and corn are taxed. Most states have sales tax asking that people pay the government if they wish to buy an item. Taxes on property, saying that you can't even have shelter without paying the government.  This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. The idea that an authority figure can charge you for buying something from someone else is kind of ridiculous, yet it is currently the case.  So it's not so wise to just say \"yeah, taxes should go up because what about the debt?\" The debt is from irresponsible spending from the government. The government is now asking us to pay for their mistakes. Furnishings that don't even benefit most of us. TJ called this shit tyrannical for a reason.   Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something.   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate. People do not end their pursuit of profit just because government has made things more expensive for them. They will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses.   As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions.   As shown, historically (as I've pointed out a few times already), private endeavors succeed far more in spreading wealth across the nation than public efforts. This is because government has no concern for efficiency. While welfare and social services may be for noble reasons, they have been unsuccessful in getting people out of the slums. Allowing businesses to operate unrestricted creates growth. More goods and services are provided at a cheaper rate because the business men want to make these items cheaply. They don't want expensive items. Expensive items mean less consumers.  As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). It goes all the way back to the bourgeoisie and we see it today with the monopolies created solely by government. The largest of corporations owe most of their strength to government regulations and restrictions that have hurt small business, subsidization and contracts that has chosen winners, and ridiculous business taxes that small businesses couldn't keep up with.   Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market.   The \"corporatist\" legislation includes major regulations on the market. Government should not have the power to put such restrictions on individuals, yet we give it that power by claims of non-trust for the free market. Free markets is very far from corporatism.   Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities.   Even if we look to a futuristic utopia where the Free Market has prevailed over tyrannical government, government's place will still be to provide basic needs (security, vouchers for food and healthcare) at a much cheaper and efficient rate. However, government currently is a bureaucratic mess and the only defense that people can have for it all is the fear of an alternative that has never done harm (in fact, 'regression' towards free markets has done wonders for the economies of the USSR and China).  Vouchers (like food stamps, or the Paul Ryan healthcare plan) are cheaper and allow the market to do what it does best, compete for customers. It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it. That is currently, however, not what government does.   I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Hardly. The expense of most food industries comes from heavy regulation and taxation. One is not allowed to sell food without going through months of expensive protocol. How can a poor person in a poor neighborhood afford to do that or keep up with all business regulations and fees? This is what impoverishes the people the most.  A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a \"red herring.\"   The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession.   Way to leave out the most important part. When the recession was occurring, the Icelandic government PANICKED and made drastic action believing that the banks wouldn't be able to handle the downfall of the European Union's dollar (the EU had much to do with this, sir). Iceland surrendered ownership of their banks to government regulators and this is where all hell broke loose. Now, the development of the banks was already a fault of government, as government, as I explained before, should have NOTHING TO DO with the banks. No start up help, no subsidies, no regulations, no nothing. Iceland would not have been able to invest so much power into three banks if they had completely avoided that market. As I've stated, it is better to either have a Centralized bank or no government involvement with banks at all. I'd choose the latter, especially today, because of the great catastrophe government has created in the banking and currency systems.   Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement   If government had stayed out of it all along, none of this would have been an issue. Iceland would have been one of the countries to avoid the mess that the EU and US created with their meddling in the private sector.   (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? Is it government's role to build up such monstrous corporations only to try and tame them and make them take care of us poor folk who need a nanny state? I find it quite shaky when we say \"hey Frankenstein, make us one of them monsters to push us around.\"   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers. For good reason, it's not very good to give the religious a voice in politics. But that's just my opinion.   it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.   Sure, but saying that still doesn't make a difference in what we're talking about.",

As far as i know he promotes progressive taxation, progressive taxation promotes aggregate demand which benefits everyone since this term is synonymous with economic health - see my other post about aggregate demand to know more about what i mean.   Immigration - How could anyone talk about Obama with respect to immigration as though he is an immigrant if he didnt immigrate to this country? Are you really that unaware of the fact that he was born in Hawaii? Do you really think that he would be able to become all the things he has become if he had forged the documents that prove his origins? I feel like the scrutiny would be really extreme prior to his taking office. The notion that he is from another country is at least slightly racist because it is a reflection of his non-anglo-american name and ethnicity which are irrelivant to that fact that he was born in the US.   On gay rights - maybe he doesnt fully support them, but he supports them way more than just about any other option. who is more in support of them than he?   on Middle class taxes - taxes must reflect government spending, insofar as there are bariers to the greater taxation for the wealthy, he is necessarily forced to tax the middle class more if he is to be fiscally responsible. I doubt that he is truly in favor of increasing taxes generally and specifically not in favor of taxing the middle class. but what other option does he have that doesnt increase the national debt?   On Foreign policy - are you arguing that he is pro war? Obama is trying to get us out of the wars we got into under bush II.

    "context": "I'm not infatuated at all, in fact I think he has been too moderate. But I'm not a retard who lives in an alternate universe where Obama has horns. He's doing a really good job especially considering what he was left with.   It is weird to believe in constitutional govt. If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   And exactly what part of the constitution has Obama not followed? That is why they are weird, they live under a number of delusions, that the government has been acting unconstitutionally only one of many. Here are some of the other tea party delusions:  1. Obama was not born here  2. Obama is taking your guns when in fact he's relaxed gun laws.  3. Obama has raised their taxes, when in fact everyone paid less taxes last year.  4. Only poor black people who want free stuff voted for him even though he won by one of the largest majorities in history  I'm sure there are more but I try not to talk to the village idiots.  Anyway, yes, on average every one really did pay less taxes. I realize that ruins many of those potato chip stuffed asses reason for leaving their recliner and making a colorful sign, but it is the truth.  Further, half the idiot tea party crying about \"Gov'ment tooks my money! WAH!\" Actually benefit from one government program or another, and would be crying even harder if the government took away their Medicare or social security.  2. No, spending really has been cut. The stimulus was passed under Bush, and under Obama most of the money has been repaid. It's yet another silly tea bagger delusion, this idea that only Obama passed the stimulus, and that the stimulus isn't the only thing that saved us from another great depression. Every expert says without it we would be living in Hoover tents right now. Anyway,   part of the problem I see, is that people like yourself when I say \"spending has been cut\" you are comparing spending now, to spending in magical fairy land, while I on the other hand am dealing with reality, and the spending during the Bush years.  3. Uh, no.  Every  country that has a similar plan, and usually an even more liberal plan than what was passed here, spends less per capita on healthcare. That means they have more money. That means they are less likely to have financial meltdowns due to healthcare. Again, you do not argue in reality. Look at any chart of healthcare spending and you will see the US spent nearly twice as much as any country before this was passed.  4. Oh my god, are you literally retarded? I mean I had my suspicions when I saw your name, looks like a gay dating site title, but that aside I didn't really think you were literally retarded until I saw your number 4 point there.   Bush was handed the best economy in the history of the US due to Clinton's policies. This massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey Bush in about 3 years. Due to what you call \"stimulus\" which is really just tax cuts for people who don't need them and won't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with Reagan, we went from the greatest US economy in history to the second worst in US history.  It is truly an accomplishment in itself, how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it's knees so quickly. Now we have an intelligent person in office, and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last, and in some instances actual job gains,  and still you preach Bush era economic strategy. It is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless.  Honestly I'm bored of you now.  I will add though to your \"bigot\" comment. You do realize that if Obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen. Sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a Faux Noise media alternate Universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is, but most are pissed because \"real America\" as they put it, in there view does not include black people. Disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to Hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin.  And I don't want to hear the old line \"no that's not it uh, uh, it's his policies.\"  Bullshit. Where was the tea party in the Clinton years? Where was the tea party when Bush with the help of that troll Cheyenne destroyed the strongest economy in the world? Nowhere, because Clinton and Bush are white. Bigot indeed.",

What's the point of saving for retirement if the dollars will be worthless when it's time to retire. If you support obama you support being broke. The only change i see are questionable policies and turning the dollars into change faster than any other president.

Patriot Act  I totally agree with you.  Turning his back to those accused of being terrorists  Last time I checked that guy that tried to bomb Times Square was read his Miranda Rights, so that argue is pointless.  Jumping through obstacles and use of bullying to get unpopular legislation passed  I totally agree with you.  Allowing Wall Street to do whatever the fuck they want.  He has a huge majority but 59 votes isn't enough to pass legislation, you need 60 votes to have a true \"majority,\" and true, the Republicans aren't being very helpful, in fact, their no help at all.  Allowing the Federal Reserve to do whatever they want.  I my personal opinion the Federal Reserve Board should all be shot.  Allowing big banks to do whatever the fuck they want.  They also should be shot. (Again just my personal opinion.)  Allowing giant corporations deemed \"too big to fail\" to do whatever the fuck they want.  They should have let GM collapsed and that way the auto worker union would have be broken up and jerk off would be getting paid $40+ an hour for putting a damn blot on a car.  Watch as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fail.  Should also have their board members shot. (my personal opinion.)  Bailout failing entities.  I don't want to sound fucked up but we shouldn't have sent a crap load of money to Haiti when we got our own financial problems to worry about.  Backroom deals hidden from the public.  Has always happened and always will.  Criticize the public for the same mistakes that he commits.  What do you except when the \"Teabaggers\" are waving signs with him depicted as Hilter on them. He was elected, he did not steal the election. (Unlike Bush, but thats a whole different discussion.)  Holding a party while states are experiencing extreme natural disasters.  Because Bush didn't do the exact same thing with Katrina right?  Offshore drilling.  I totally agree.  Go against gay marriage.  Again, totally agree.  Have no sense of fiscal responsibilty.  Atleast he's trying to fix the economy, all Bush did was sit around and let it collapse.  Continue War on Drug.  Agreed.  Pretend to be for safe border but at the same time doing nothing to protect them.  What is the point of trying to do something about this, the only thing Republicans would support is deporting everyone so there is no point of him trying to debate the immigration topic.  Promoting environmental while at the same time failing to get some real legislation done.  Kind of hard when no Republican is willing to open talks with the Democrats.

I mean when you can smell someone smoking marijuana from down the street, it's a social issue. In time even the smell gives me a bad headache. Maybe it's in my head, but none of you have the right to put me through that just so that you can say you can get baked legally.  At least cigars and cigarettes odors dissipate fairly quickly, and their odor, while somewhat bad, are not sharp bad pungent odors that carry down the street and waft through people's windows.  Geez, I can't even have my window open sometimes on a warm summer night or a decent time in my backyard on a Friday night because of my next door neighbor who doesn't seem to care that the odor is very strong across the fence in my yard.  It's ridiculous really. Not to mention, with all the problems we have with the mind-altering substance called alcohol, we'd be opening a whole new host of problems if marijuana were legalized, not to mention the public health concern. I know, I know, Marijuana only alters the mind and it has no harmful fumes, yeah, well, wait until it goes public and it's everywhere, I think we'll find, as we do with almost everything, it's not what we assumed it would be. We may even find it's not as safe as we thought. And imagine someone who happens to be very allergic to the stuff, you can smell that stuff from several yards away, and in some cases as far as football field or more if the wind is just right.   I have no issues with it being legalized for people to do on their own, away from the public, but that's not what will happen is it. No, what will happen is people will test their boundaries, insist that it can be smoked anywhere regardless of who is affected by it, and that will go on for a while until it's finally brought to court, and years later legislation is finally made that says it can't be smoked in public places or where it causes other discomfort. Then people will fight that saying that there are not harmful side-effects, if in fact we don't discover any, which we won't at first, and they will attempt to smoke it in places where others are affected by it anyway.   And then we've proven how responsible we are with legal mind-altering substances by how we use alcohol. Some of us are while many others of us are not, and really, to legalize marijuana would mean a whole new era of legislation to control everyone that would not regard others in their use of the substance. At least now, they have to regard others or risk having the police called on them.",

They are not mutually exclusive.  And yes, many people want to get high on cannabis. That's why we're here. If you can come up with a good reason why that should be illegal, I'm all ears. So far, I haven't heard anything. People using drugs is not bad, we do it all the time (caffeine, Tylenol, Vicoden). People using dangerous drugs is bad. If you can prove that pot is dangerous to society, I'm all ears. No one has been able to do so. Ever.",

Most street-level cannabis dealers would get their product from someone who grows it in the same country - the profit margin of cannabis is small compared to other drugs so importing it is usually not financially worthwhile. Also, you're forgetting that ending the prohibition of marijuana would cut these suppliers out of the system and force them to go legit. Alcohol prohibition in the '30s forced alcohol into the hands of organised crime, and provided them with a source of income as well as putting the general population in danger of an unregulated alcohol market. Once the prohibition was lifted this took away the criminals' largest source of income and allowed the government to control the standards of alcoholic drinks. The same principle applies here - organised criminals would have one less source of income, and the rumoured 'dangerously strong strains of cannabis' could be outlawed so companies growing the plant would only sell it at a sensible and controlled strength.  Also, your argument about cannabis users experimenting with other drugs such as cocaine and heroin: this 'gateway drug' argument is simply unusable in the argument concerning legalisation because legalisation would remove the drug's gateway effects. The idea of cannabis being a gateway drug stems from the idea that, in pursuit of buying cannabis, an individual would associate themselves with the people who sell it: criminals. Drug dealers (like any businessman) naturally want to maximise their profit so they would offer up a stronger drug later on. The lack of distinction between cannabis and stronger drugs (because they're all illegal anyway) would mean the user is more open to trying these drugs. Legalisation would not only remove the criminal market but would also create a visible barrier between what is safe to try and what isn't.  In conclusion, the legalisation of marijuana would be, ultimately, a harm reduction measure. Gangs would lose a source of income and would become less powerful, users would no longer have to associate with criminals, and for once the population of what is meant to be a free country would have the power to make a decision that affects no-one but themselves.

The \"one step over the line, it's hardly anything\" lead to \"one more step\" leads to \"one more step\", and before you know it the line is so far back that you can't see your starting position any more.   He didn't start using pot because he wanted to be high. He started using it to fit in with a crowd of people. He was very susceptible to peer pressure. That's the reason he went on to other drugs. He continued to use pot after we moved to a different town, because by that time it was habitual. New place, new pressure to make friends, put him into contact with dealers who were selling more than just pot. And he so desperately wanted to be \"friends\" with his dealer. So yes, it was his fault, because if he hadn't been such a weak assed spineless wimp of a man he would have stuck by his guns.

I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",

I'm not going to go into detail explaining what many have already said, about the medical uses, stress relief, etc, but when it comes to the profit that could be made this way, an enormous amount of opportunities open up.  First thing that comes to mind with the legal sale of Marijuana is tax. Why have a tax other then sales tax? Hell, why not? Are you not willing to pay that extra amount to be able to legally smoke? Is that extra tax not worth being able to sit in clear view and toke it up without worrying about going to jail if you're caught? Of course it is!  Realistically, we could add the Cigarette tax from each state onto a package of Joints. 4 average rolled joints at $10 + tax. Sure, you're getting slightly less than a dime's worth, but again, that extra amount is more than worth it.  If marijuana was to be considered for legalization, and lets say they were to use Texas as the Beta-State, a package of 4 joints would cost $11.41 after tax. Lets say Joe goes through the average dime in about 2 days. That's 178 dime bags in a year. As of now that would cost him $1780, and it would cost $2030.98 if it was legalized and taxed. That is $250.98 more than he would normally pay for a slightly less amount of weed. About .1 gram per package to be exact, on average.  That is $250.98 in profit to the government, in 1 year, from 1 man. That means slightly under 4000 people (3985) would allow the government to make a profit of one million dollars.  Did I mention that is in addition to the money saved yearly on arrest and court costs? Imagine this... 6458 (adjusted for the California cigarette tax) people in California smoke marijuana once it has become legalized. That's $1 million in profit, in addition to saving the $100 million that it is estimated to spend yearly on arrest and court costs. I'm failing to see the problem with this idea.  On a large scale, I think I read somewhere about 10% of the American population admitted to smoking marijuana. The last estimated count was about 303.8 million people in the US, so 30.38 million have admitted to regular use. The average tax on cigarettes around the US is about $.53 per pack, at even just 1 dime per week, equals to an average profit of $837.27 million dollars annually.  This estimate does not include the millions of Americans who did not admit to their regular use, nor to the hundreds of millions that would be saved on arrest and court costs.  In addition, think of all the new job openings of adding several large scale marijuana plantations. Hundreds of job possibilities open up, allowing the percentage of jobless adults to decrease. Hell, make a few new college courses about Marijuana History, Growing Marijuana, the Cultivation of Marijuana. Easily opening up new job opportunities for people to strive for. Sure, it's not the perfect job, but if you can convince people to go to school for it, and make a college degree required to work on the plantation, I bet it would convince hundreds of students to return to school with their career choice in mind.  All of these are just estimates and I have no way of knowing any exacts. But as my estimates are reasonable, and pretty close to being exact with the information I've researched, even if it didn't provide an adequate source to replace paper products, or medical uses, or any of the other dozen + things that marijuana is useful for, the profit in taxes and the annual savings in court costs and the job opportunities more than justify the legalization of marijuana.",

Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.",

All this still happens, but because it is illegal, it takes place less often. Don't people still sell marijuana and don't people still smoke it? Yes, they do. It's just much more dangerous and expensive to do so because it's illegal.  I believe the core of our disagreement here seems to be that we have opposing viewpoints on marijuana alone, whereas you seem to think of it as something bad; some kind of scourge of society. I don't see it that way. There has been endless debate over whether or not marijuana is harmful, and I choose to believe it's really not that bad. Either way, it should be a level-minded individual's choice to smoke marijuana, just like it's their choice if they wish to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, both very destructive substances, yet still legal. My core belief is that it should be the individual's choice whether to do something or not.  Although there is some small chance that you are  not  calling me a pothead, let's get something straight; I've never smoked marijuana, I've never done any other drug, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke cigarettes, and to be honest, I really don't plan on doing any of the above.

    "context": "First off in the initial few paragraphs I am talking about any leisure in general and not just cannabis, remember you said people are morally/ethically wrong if they stop working, and especially if they enjoy something. You also seem to think I am saying it would be okay to do leisurely activities while on the job which I didn't. However if your responsibilities are finished it is better you enjoy yourself than be a robot who thinks its wrong to enjoy things be it cannabis, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. Either way, ethics or morals it doesn't matter I still don't see why someone else ought to live by your personal ethics/morals.   And your correct that leisure does not require marijuana however some people enjoy using marijuana in their leisure time. And unless we want to set up a draconian system to make all pleasures wrong (which you would probably support) it is hypocritical to allow some substances and not others, especially if those other substances are less harmful.  You still have not given a reason to keep drugs illegal. It is an inconsistent argument and if we want to start taking away one persons right to what they enjoy in their spare time when will it stop? I may not know what you personally enjoy but I should not have the right to deprive you of your enjoyment if your not harming anyone else.  As far as a study that proves happier workers are more productive here is one of the first articles that came up with google, mind you I didn't search for long...   http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/ workinglife/article990727.ece    The use of marijuana hurts no one but the individual who choses to use it. Why should it be anyone else's choice whether they hurt themselves or not. And if they do abuse marijuana to the point of harming themselves how is it the substances fault? Should we criminalize knives because I could possibly slit my own wrists? I really don't believe your completely consistent with your line of thinking. But you could be. My question is who gets to determine these arbitrary rules? Because that is all drug criminalization is, for the most part just a random arbitrary law for no reason other than control.",

    "context": "First off in the initial few paragraphs I am talking about any leisure in general and not just cannabis, remember you said people are morally/ethically wrong if they stop working, and especially if they enjoy something. You also seem to think I am saying it would be okay to do leisurely activities while on the job which I didn't. However if your responsibilities are finished it is better you enjoy yourself than be a robot who thinks its wrong to enjoy things be it cannabis, alcohol, food, sex, whatever. Either way, ethics or morals it doesn't matter I still don't see why someone else ought to live by your personal ethics/morals.   And your correct that leisure does not require marijuana however some people enjoy using marijuana in their leisure time. And unless we want to set up a draconian system to make all pleasures wrong (which you would probably support) it is hypocritical to allow some substances and not others, especially if those other substances are less harmful.  You still have not given a reason to keep drugs illegal. It is an inconsistent argument and if we want to start taking away one persons right to what they enjoy in their spare time when will it stop? I may not know what you personally enjoy but I should not have the right to deprive you of your enjoyment if your not harming anyone else.  As far as a study that proves happier workers are more productive here is one of the first articles that came up with google, mind you I didn't search for long...   http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/ workinglife/article990727.ece    The use of marijuana hurts no one but the individual who choses to use it. Why should it be anyone else's choice whether they hurt themselves or not. And if they do abuse marijuana to the point of harming themselves how is it the substances fault? Should we criminalize knives because I could possibly slit my own wrists? I really don't believe your completely consistent with your line of thinking. But you could be. My question is who gets to determine these arbitrary rules? Because that is all drug criminalization is, for the most part just a random arbitrary law for no reason other than control.",

Studies have been done that prove if you take breaks and have more leisure time you are a much more effective worker. Now obviously if you are neglecting your responsibilities leisure is bad.\"   I want to see these studies. There are a lot of jobs that require people to stay active for long periods of time, I don't see them handing out weed and duritos and telling people to take an enjoyable break. Look at book camp as an example. Sure it's tough, but what isn't that you're trying to do well.   \"In your next response you talk about how you morally think doing things that are unproductive or enjoyable are wrong. I have several problems with this.  First off, honestly I'm not you and neither is anyone else why should we have to be held accountable to your unreasonable and arbitrary morals.    I said also said ethics.    \"Second off if we never did stop working productivity would fall because everyone would be unhappy. Unhappy people are not productive. Society would not operate like this so it is unreasonable to expect people to operate without leisure time.\"   This is hilarious. You decline to recognize any validity in my morals or even that I mentioned ethics as well, but holy shit, it's so important to me that you're unhappy without your substance...    \"If you are going to tell people whether they can or cannot use substances such as Cannabis; than at least have a better reason than your supposed morals that almost half the country disagrees with. You admit to being hypocritical about your no-leisure rule by being on the internet rather than doing something productive and who is to say that is all your hypocritical about. So even you don't follow your own ethics/morals.\"   I am being hypocritical, but that's not the point. Leisure doesn't require marijuana, or any other drug. Contributing an argument is anything but leisure.   \"But that is besides the point, as a completely productive citizen who works full time and goes to school full time, why do I have to go through illegal channels to enjoy a healthier substance (Cannabis) than a legal substance (Alcohol) in my spare time. Decriminalization is not enough. The game is over, we know that Cannabis is no worse and possibly better than Alcohol and denying people the right to a trustworthy and accountable Cannabis industry is authoritarian at best.\"*   You have this idea, that by doing what is expected of you by todays society, that you're doing good.",

    "context": "Recent studies that were highlighted in the BBC3 UK documentary \"Should I smoke Pot?\" showed marijuana is actually more dangerous than I previously believed. The really interesting point the documentary highlighted was the risk of psychosis from taking the drug where the THC content was very high. In one session a test subject rated a 14 for psychosis, it was highlighted that a 1 or 2 was normal and above a 4 was generally considered to be in the ballpark of the schizophrenic.  Why am I bringing this up when I'm against criminalising the drug? The answer really lies in how people get hold of marijuana in the first place. People will, no matter what the law tries to enforce, use marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes. With that said these users have no real access to quality control over their drug. They can get hold of very high THC content skunk which can quickly make them paranoid and prone to all the negative effects of psychosis. Where they may be better choosing a much lower THC variety imported.  If the drug were controlled, distributed legally and taxed. The levels could be monitored, the dealers, many of whom are dealing in harder drugs and offering those up too would be out of business overnight. This would sever the link some users have who are suggestable to moving onto harder drugs. Also de-criminalising the drug will make it easier to treat people who do end up abusing it and need help. If you have a drink problem today, you can turn to friends and family as well as your doctor. If you're a \"druggy\" you're very unlikely to get any help from anyone, making any problem you might develop possibly worse.  With everything legal and marijuana available in cafes (as they are in Amsterdam for instance) the public can be educated on what the real side effects of the drugs are, what the benefits are and have the ability to choose wisely on various strains to find one that suits that person. Just as I might end up finding out I prefer shandy when I go to bars. A mixture of beer and lemonade which makes it less alcoholic.   Finally I think the children would benefit too. If it became socially acceptable to smoke pot in special cafes open only to adults then children would not have easy access as they do now with all the street dealers around.",

The numbers for marijuana related auto deaths compared to alcohol are laughable. Keep in mind many people also drive while on vicoden, anti-depressents, etc. The lesson here is don't drive if your fucked up (on anything).  3. Pfffffff. Arguing that the government would regulate it in a way that would increase the price is ridiculous. If I could buy a 'pack' of marijuana cigarettes for the same price as tobacco, even while tobacco is heavily taxed, that would be awesome and very very cheap. Have you heard the numbers that the government has been considering? I've heard $50 a plant for growing - a single plant can procure about 6 grand worth of medicine. It's still going to be cheap.  4. Just because you don't like it or how it effects other people gives you no right to make choices for others. Just like just because I don't like drinking doesn't mean I think everyone should be banned from drinking.  Even if you think Legalizing is not the solution - the war on drugs is also NOT the solution. A good solution might be to change the war on drugs to be the war on addiction, and then also legalize pot.",

Marijuana legalized =&gt; More people use marijuana =&gt; More people drive high =&gt; There will be many more deaths as a result  Hypothetically speaking even if marijuana was proven to cause as much driving impairment as alcohol, this would still not be grounds for it to be illegal. One of the most dangerous things to do while driving is sleeping. But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.  Your arguments are bogus and based upon myths and social stigma. I will gladly debate you on the legalization of marijuana.",

The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort",

Currently, also, cannabis is a gateway drug because the same people that end up handling it, handle other hard core drugs. If it were legal, those people would have no desire to traffic marijuana because there would be no underground market (like there is no underground market for tobacco and alcohol). Therefore, marijuana would no longer be a gateway drug.  Making the argument that marijuana legalization would lead to Meth legalization, and THATS why we shouldn't legalize is pretty poor.

Hemp used to be used for making rope and paper, the constitution in fact is written on hemp, but not anymore. It has even been suggested that the textiles industry is in on keeping the drug war going just to protect their market.

By contrast, 51.9 percent of Americans age 12 and older (or roughly 100 million people) had used alcohol at least once in the 30 days prior to being surveyed in America.

The ones who it takes a lot to get them to try anything new. The ones who after months and months of \"Just try it, on the house, no worries,\" finally give in thinking \"Just once.\" That's how my ex started on speed. For years he had smoked pot, saying that doing anything else was a fool's game. But all his \"mates\" (i.e. his dealer and the guys he hung out with while he was at his dealer's house) were doing it, and they were all egging him on. So the first time, he tried it at a quarter dose. But he refused to inject it. He was adamant about that. He dropped balls... meaning he swallowed small amounts of speed wrapped up in cigarette papers. For about a year he tried it off and on, which was enough time for him to get well and truly hooked on it. At which point he started injecting it. I left him soon after. He's gone on to do pretty much everything since, and last I heard he was on the methadone program.  If pot had been available over the counter, I doubt that his habit would have escalated beyond pot.

This process would use only 1/4 to 1/7 as much polluting sulfur-based acid chemicals to break down the glue-like lignin that binds the fibers of the pulp, or even none at all using soda ash. The problem of dioxin contamination of rivers is avoided in the hemp paper making process, which does not need to use chlorine bleach (as the wood pulp paper making process requires) but instead safely substitutes hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching process. ... If the new (1916) hemp pulp paper process were legal today, it would soon replace about 70% of all wood pulp paper, including computer printout paper, corrugated boxes and paper bags.\"  From  http://www.jackherer.com/   $100,000 Challenge to Prove Us Wrong!

The best way I can put it is that it relaxes you enough for you to notice the world around you. It slows the momentum of life so that you are more aware of your environment. This leads me to my next part. It's going to require a leap, so follow me. The only function of our government is to maintain a robust economy. Most everything can be understood under this one assumption. The main goal of our government is to keep us preoccupied, to keep us serving the economy by producing and consuming. Our government is a client of corporations. It's another tool that large businesses use to reach their goals. They invest in government like they invest in a business venture, with the expectation that it will make them more money.   A requirement of this ever churning, ever expanding economy is the passivity of its participants' inquiries and the maintenance of their blind actions. This brings me to my conclusion. When you smoke marijuana, you start to think more about the requirements of your brain and your mind (What do I truly NEED?) You start to ask questions like, \"Do I really need that many THINGS?\", \"Is it natural to be obligated to a flourescently lit office building for 40 hrs every week of your life to basically move paper from one place to another, to be treated like a child whose time is monitored, and reprimanded by a \"boss\"?\" \"Do I get meaning from my life or am I just a cog in the wheel of this economy, eg. is it essential for the universe to contain operating services clerical specialists?\" \"Why can't I grow a plant in my backyard, but I can be on numerous synthetic prescription medications?\"  There are other reasons that marijuana should be legal or at least decriminalized, but I believe this is the biggest obstacle: We might actually wake up and analyze what our lives are, what consequences our behaviors have on ourselves, our neighbors, and the rest of the world. We might stop consuming.",

    "context": "Marijuana should be legalized BECAUSE it is dangerous.   If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.",

It upsets motor coordination, causing unsteady hands, a change in gait, uncontrolled laughter, and a lag between thought and facial expressions. Sexual functions can also be disturbed. Short-term memory deteriorates. In early stages of the use of marijuana, some users will suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most users may find that when they are high the whites of their eyes and facial skin become red, and the pupils dilate and become sensitive to light, increase in appetite, and a dryness in the mouth and throat. What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. \"Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness.\" So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, \"depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy.\" 123helpme.com  This make you want to smoke mary? :) cus it certainly doesnt apeal to me.",

First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfish   My response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that \"completes the family\", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them \"you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!\"   Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them    Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?  Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.   Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can \"appoint\" someone to look after their child   Someone actually used the word \"property\", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else.   Since when are human beings \"property\"?  As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young.   Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight.    But the child is going to be bullied!   Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents?   The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap.

    "context": "In China the Confunacists said that the first duty is to raise a family and take care of them and overlooked homosexuality if it was discreet and private.  The Greeks said that those who penetrated were dominant and masculine and those who got penetrated (LOL!!!) were feminine and submissive.  I could go on forever.. but none of the cultures allowed gay marriage.    Not many had open gay relations   So homosexuality isn't immoral since time immemorial, glad to see you agree on that.  In ancient Greece the male form was considered the ideal of beauty and the ancient Romans were fond of rampant homosexuality. If there was no gay marriage then I don't see how it impacts now, do we still have gladiatorial events where people are killed for amusement, NO. Do we still have widespread slavery, NO. Do we still have a view of women as second class citizens, NO. (OK we still have these things in some more devoutly religious  and obviously morally advanced:)  countries.)  But because of some all too conservative people, the rights of two people to be happy are denied based on out-dated texts and bigoted moral judgments. The fact that in the western world that the only real opposition to things like gay marriage comes from the religious communities is telling of their archaic and flawed morality. Gay people can not help being the way they are, it is not a belief system, or a choice it is an ingrained hormonally shaped sexuality, and if you are not this way you should count yourself lucky. Imagine being brought into a world where the very nature of yourself is ridiculed on any given day, where want you feel drawn to without explanation or choice is being chastised by huge groups of people, people that do not want to listen to evidence or reason, they KNOW they are right and that is that, and they WILL make your life hell because they deem themselves superior and in the right. A gay couple can not get married in a religious ceremony, so if they are not put together in the eyes of whichever God it is then it should not matter to the religious if Gay people had a legal ceremony or not.    TBH they are generally in line with me. Good to know that   They are not in line with you mate, as I said before in ancient Greece and Rome homosexuality was rampant and anyway even if ancient civilizations are in line with you then that shows where your morals stand, outdated and archaic.",

You haven't shown abnormal behavior to be unacceptable, just stated that it is frequently unaccepted - by people like you.  I suppose the once deviant notion that a woman's word was equal to that of a man's, the abnormal view that women should be allowed to vote and own property was just \"a slide of hands\" by the women's rights movement. And, of course, if we apply your logic evenly, this makes them immoral and unethical for perpetrating deviant behavior. Godforbid we see it as social progress, it was something new and different, how could it be?   Your slippery slope argument comes off more like paranoia.

It is not recognized by our constitution as a right. The end. And it won't get added. If a state wants to legalize it they can try.  Personally, I say don't legalize it nor make it illegal, that way it will not be legally recognized however a person can either deny or accept \"ceremonially\" performing a wedding for them.",

    "context": "Thanks for making my point. Your argument is a good example of trying to define marriage. You said \"Marriage is a contract\" it may be true that most marriages have some form of a contract but that is just a formality and not the marriage. A contract defines the parameters of something that exist independent of the contract; it doesn't make the thing. See this is were we get into trouble, when we try to define the nature of something. Because the nature of the object is defined by itself, not the subject. For example lets say I wanted to define you and I said; ostdrauka99 is a long haired cat of about 20lbs and you would reply; no I'm not, I'm a.... See I would do better in describing you as you actually are. So it is with marriage, we need to describe it as it actually is, not what we think it is. And historically speaking marriage has almost always been seen has the joining of male and female for procreation. Which leads us to the next question.  \"When two people want to have a contract with each other, why should everyone else care about the purpose of that contract or the sexual orientation of the contractual partners?\"  In the case of marriage it's because they normally produce kids. Why does that matter to the state? consider the following report;  http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/docs/                                        costofdivorce.pdf    So yes, this type of relationship is of serious concern for government and they would be wise to do everything they can to support and encourage it. And primarily because marriages produce the next generation.  You said\" The human spirit should be without bonds\" this pernicious little lie has been the root of all kinds of human evil, not to mention the question of this debate. People doing what ever they want without restraint is anarchy and detrimental to society, it's why we have laws. If we are going to flourish some restraint is necessary. But let me ask you, what is more creative and productive, the undisciplined mind or the disciplined mind? Before you respond let me remind you of your education that allows you to read and write, with out which you couldn't have this debate.  Final thought. You said \"Don't make it an issue of orientation because the end result is the same effect.\" Heterosexual couples typically reproduce and homosexual couples never do. How is that the same effect and how does this avoid being a contradiction since you say \"A\" is the same as \"non-A\"",

Once again, look more closely at what I said. That is Leviticus 20:13. I don't need to search the entire book to find something you don't believe. It amuses me that you didn't even look 4 lines higher, at 20:9 when you were demonstrating how well you know the bible.   \"For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.\"  Murder everyone, even small children, that has ever cursed at their parents? That would require the deaths of millions of 10 year olds. I assume you don't believe this. This is in fact said in the very same speech that your quote comes from.   We can even go all the way down to 20:18, where it clearly states that having sex with your wife while she is menstruating should be met with exile. Seems a little harsh considering it is possible for it to start during sex.   Then it states things that have been dis-proven. \"If a man shall lie with his uncle's wife ... they shall die childless.\" (20:20), so even if you have shady morals regarding periods and child murder, you cannot claim that everything in this chapter is true.  All I am trying to say is that you are choosing passages to belief and passages to ignore.

There is not even a direct ban on discrimination based on race, color, or creed. What we do have are provisions that are often interpreted that way. The 15th and 19th Amendments, which ensured that blacks and women could vote, hint at a policy of non-discrimination, but they are actually quite specific. They only involve suffrage and nothing else. However, the due process clause of the 14th Amendment has been interpreted to mean that discrimination based on traits such as race are a violation of due process and not constitutional (when done by the government or an agent of the government). It is a complex issue. Again, a ban on discrimination based on sexual preference is not a part of the Constitution, but has been extended, to some degree, based on the 14th Amendment by the courts. The subject is far from a closed one at this time.\"  In fact I\u00c2\u00b4m socked.

I've seen CHRISTIAN parents kick they're children out of the house, becouse they don't live up to the parents christian standards. Some teenagers get pregnant, find out they're gay or something else, that don't 'fit in' the church.  And thats aweful. When christians do that, I wonder if there is any difference between islam and christianity after all. You know christians are going around and telling people how good and kind they are? And the next you know their children are on their own on the street.  Not only underage children.

It is not recognized by our constitution as a right. The end. And it won't get added. If a state wants to legalize it they can try.  Personally, I say don't legalize it nor make it illegal, that way it will not be legally recognized however a person can either deny or accept \"ceremonially\" performing a wedding for them.",

What I agree is that the scriptures are open to interpretation by anyone, just because a conventional wisdom points them in a certain way does not indicate their intent. What I was also stating is that they are written by men, in this respect they are flawed.   Oh no! I'm a bigot. I'm so ashamed and terrified. Faggot   That is up to you.   And IM the one in denial.   Maybe you are, maybe you are not, but the matter of the fact is that homosexuals are here to stay, it is your choice to be bothered by them, although I don't see why you would as they are only living out their lives as they wish which is everyone right.   Ohh you're being gay again....   So by pointing out your mistake in the use of a word, I am attracted to people of the same sex, if you are unsure of what a gay person is I would advise checking it out before entering a debate about it.   Homosexuality is immoral since time immemorial   Homosexuality was a part of many ancient civilizations such as, Greece, Rome, China, etc   Homosexuality is condemned by 99% of all religions   Probably true of most modern religions.   Homosexuals are trying to make hetreosexual things their's i.e. marriage.   Marriage between heterosexual couples is performed as both a religious and a legal ceremony, Gay couples do not get married in a religious ceremony so why would it bother you? Homosexuals are human the same as heterosexuals, should they not have the same rights?   Homosexuals are gay   If you mean happy then I'm glad for them and wonder why you are not.  If you mean they are homosexuals then there is nothing more to say other than Duuuhhhhh.   You're gay   If you mean happy, yes I am. If you mean homosexual then no I am not, why would you consider me a homosexual? unless your gaydar is going off.",

Your anus or a plastic/steel/wooden rod is not a sexual organ; therefore using them in a sexual act should be considered abnormal, shouldn't it? Having anal sex is like trying to eat food with your eyes (it just was not design for that). The normal curve is used in all fields of studies to classify what is acceptable and what's not. It also determines when mechanical plants are to be changed, unearths systematic errors and blunders. Of special concern are systematic errors, which are frequently caused by miscalibration. This error in a system also produces normal curve, but skewed. Thus, shifting the goal post thereby making previously deviance behaviour acceptable.

The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say.

In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up.

The quotes I used weren't direct quotes, but were typical of things that males our age might say to each other. I even admitted to saying them myself. I was not trying to accuse you or any other gay marriage opponent of anything, merely to demonstrate what the culture is. Also do not think I am accusing you specifically of saying these things, because I do not know you. In fact it seems very likely that you use this language less then me, if at all.   It's so obvious what you are trying and failing to do.   Clearly not to you.  Once again I am not trying to paint a stereotype...I am telling you what  all  kids are age say. Not liberals, not conservatives, but males in there teens or early twenties. Do you deny this? Are there not people at your school who use these terms? Let's get off our high horse for two seconds here Jake.   If you read the bible instead of cherrypicking quotes out of the book out of context then we can talk. Or you could just watch the west wing.   Jake, how many times do I have to tell you? I was raised a Catholic! I go to church  every Sunday , and usually I even pay attention.   In fact I'm pretty sure I have a Bible in my room. Let me go get it....yep here it is (it even still has the bookmarks from my conformation class).   There is a lot of symbolism in the bible that you would not understand.   That's pretty presumptuous Jake. Also pretty hypocritical of someone accusing me of arrogance. But let's ignore this for now.  So Jake, I'm sitting here Bible in hand. Dazzle me with you intellectual superiority. Explain to me why you are right when you claim that homosexuality is a sin, yet those people who justified male superiority though the Bible, and kept women as second class citizens for the majority of human history were wrong. What is the symbolism of saying that a womans menstrual cycle makes here unclean, or that any man who touches her is unclean as well? (Leviticus 15:19-27)  Enlighten me.  Jake, explain to my why the story of genesis is not also symbolic, even though every scientific discovery of the last hundred years has proven it to be false when taken literally.   I believe procreation to be sacred and should only be within the marriage of a man and a woman, anything other is wrong because it distorts from the family which is also eternal and sacred.   Finally a legitimate response. Now we can have an actual discussion.  Are you also for making divorce, premarital sex, adultery, and masturbation illegal as well? Do they not also help to defeat the sanctity of marriage and family?  How do you feel about those studies which that being raised by parents of the same sex has no ill effects on the child? Those same studies show that what tends to hurt children is only having one parent, or in the case of orphans no parents. Would you rather orphans had no parents then two parents of the same sex?  Here is my main question...if you do not deny that homosexuals are born gay, then why would God make them as he did. Why would God intentionally put them in a situation where, if they want to love someone romantically (as a husband loves a wife), they are sinning. What kind of a cruel God would do that?  Jake, clearly homosexuals want to have sex...almost everyone does. You also are of the opinion that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. Why then, would you want to stop homosexuals from making their love and actions more moral?   Is it cool to call yourself a sarcastic dick?   It's called a self effacing joke. Look it up. Your supposed to laugh not get offended (and you complain about PC people getting offended easily,   jeez )",

The DSM in some ways is not only a diagnostic instrument; it is a research tool in which clinicians systematically identify areas of concern in patients lives related to mental functioning, and this is a relationship that cannot be easily detached in theory or reality. Some of these broad categories, then, are just that -- they are useful analytical tools, but they are not necessarily 1:1::theory:reality the same thing as a real disease. We may find one day (assuming this example for the argument) that Autism is not one disease but multiple, perhaps independent, \"pathogenic\" sources affecting a conglomeration of people who (1) meet the classification due to mostly environmental reasons such as metal poisoning, or (2) meet the classification generally due to a biological reason with both a genetic and environmental cofactor, and perhaps (3) some amount of people who simply represent the statistical extremes of normal human variation. The above example is dry, but the implications are important to what you are saying, because you take the DSM as a supreme way of describing expert opinion on what is pathological (except for when it is corrupted by politicians), when the DSM doubles both as a clinical tool and a research tool.  Also, if you don't trust the DSM IV-TR of current time (because of political powers interfering with the DSM revision process), and you also now believe that research material can be politically influenced (it's fair to say it can, though we must also be concerned with scope and magnitude), what research material are you going to have us trust that also coincidentally supports your argument about how homosexuality is pathological?

In another sense, they are right for not increasing the numbers of their own race. Contradicting but true. Why? Overpopulation is the answer. Overpopulation can decrease the advancement of growth because if we use all of earth's resources, life would be hard to sustain. Now im not educated in the dangers that overpopulation can propose. If they propose no danger or if the danger i presented is incorrect, then please correct me....if you want to, of course. :D",

I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word \"married.\"   Would you rather use the word \"married\" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash.   The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them.   The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them.   The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.  The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right.   I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.  Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.  One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.  God give me the strength to change the things I can,  the patience to put it with the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference.",

I was raised to believe that all homosexuals were going to hell and that the only cure was a good woman. So at the age of 20 I married. I cried and prayed many nights for God to make the thought of a man be repulsive to me and after 11 years of marriage I finally realized I was gay and had been all along. My feelings for men had been with me since I was young, the first memory I have was at the age of 11. I so desperately wanted to fit in, to be accepted by my family, to go to Heaven.

You can't make a valued judgement on whether something is true or not if you have no evidence. Tell me how else do you want me to make it simpler for you?

Too much people to carry.    WRONG . Overpopulation refers to a situation where the population of an area exceeds the carrying capacity of the area. I'm a Geography scholar, see. So don't try and pull any stunts with Geographical terminology with me ;)   t relates to homosexuality because homosexuality supports and does not support the purpose of life.   Which is a contradiction. Gosh, you're really not that intelligent are you?   If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Let's break down your arguments:  P1: In a society with only  female  homosexuals, society cannot grow with no future citizens.  P2: History is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society.  Ergo  C: Homosexuality is wrong.   Response to premise 1 :  First, why does it have to be only  female  homosexuals? Second, you are misconstruing \"society\" and \"population\". According to the OED, \"society\" refers to \"Association with one's fellow men, esp. in a friendly or intimate manner; companionship or fellowship.\" On the other hand, \"population\" refers to \"A totality of objects or individuals under consideration, of which the statistical attributes may be estimated by the study of a sample or samples drawn from it.\" So, while homosexuality might not increase the  population size , this has no bearing on whether  society  will grow or not. Society can grow independently of population through increased cohesiveness and tolerance, which you lack.   Response to premise 2 :  It is a hasty generalisation to say that  all  societies have the desire to conquer and grow. Furthermore, I've shown that society can grow with homosexuality, so your second premiss makes no sense.  And therefore, since both of your premises are not true and it is illogical to believe that your two premises lead to the conclusion that homosexuality is wrong, your argument is illogical and hence holds no water.   If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   I have no quarrel with your argument here except for the last part. There is no conclusive evidence to show that with homosexuality, overpopulation will not occur. As I have shown, your definition of overpopulation is flawed. Again I repeat, I am well learned in Geography and demography, so don't fuck around with definitions and pretend to be knowledgeable in front of me. We can have homosexuality, but if each couple still gives birth to 20 children, overpopulation  might  still occur. Furthermore, it  DOES NOT  mean that if we allow homosexuals to marry, then everyone will turn homosexual. There still  will  be heterosexuals and in fact, there won't be any change as to the number of heterosexuals since homosexuals will probably not marry someone of the opposite gender anyway.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both \"right\" AND \"wrong\" at the same time.   I have shown that both your arguments are fallacious. You are wrong on both arguments at the same time.   If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment.   You have asserted to claims without evidence. First, how are you wrong for taking the life of Hitler? And second, where is the proof that Hitler is the source of  most  of the suffering of the Jewish people?   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person.   A rapist cannot  try  to rape a person. He has  already  rape d  a person. That is an incredibly stupid statement to make.   However, i am also right for saving a life.   Committing murder is  not  a characteristic of rapists.   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the \"one child policy.\"   The One Child policy was introduced due to an abnormally high rate of population growth after the era of Mao Zedong, who preached that with more people there will be greater economic progress. The primary reason for the One Child policy was due to the unsustainable rate of population growth. While it  might  or might  not  be due to overpopulation, it is certainly due to the evidence that large populations has not lead to economic progress in China  relative  to the pressure due to the consumption of resources in China.   I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities.   Huh? What were you smoking when you said this?   The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples.   Wrong. That is only after the revision of the Policy. The original policy only said all couples were allowed to have one child. Did you know that there were on average 33  forced  abortions a day at the peak of the enforcement of the One Child policy? Please don't talk about things you don't know.

Greece and Rome did not fall due to homosexuality. The rights of homosexuals to get married promotes peace and order, because it will please them thereby preventing civil unrest.

It gives a number of scenarios:   We want the Flag of Equal Marriage to be complete, with all 50 stars lit up. We see three routes to marriage equality, as we define it:  1.

The bible isn't a moral code just because it holds conservative view points.   --------------------------------------- -----------------------     If the bible really was a source of infallible morals, then it should be perfectly moral to:    Sell one's daughters as sex slaves  (Exodus 21:7-11)   Kill adulterers  (Leviticus 20:10)   Kill blasphemers  (Leviticus 24:10-16)   Rape women  (Isaiah 13:15-18)   Kill women, babies and children  (Isaiah 14:21), (Hosea 9:11-16), (Ezekiel 9:5-7), (Exodus 12:29-30), (Isaiah 13:15-18).    --------------------------------------- ----------------------    Morality should be something which can be discussed with reason, logic and evidence. There is no logical reason why homosexuality is wrong. By denying homosexuals the right to marry you are creating a second class of people; you are discriminating against them by saying that they are not worthy of long-term, legally recognised relationships, yet heterosexuals are.",

However, you do need a piece of paper -- and be straight -- to be eligible for the considerable financial benefits given to married people. Same-sex couples in marriages, civil unions, or domestic partnerships in the U.S. do not have 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges that a married couple has under federal law.  When African Americans turned to the courts to help protect their constitutional rights, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation of any kind deprived African Americans of equal protection. Gay Americans also want the same rights, benefits and protections provided to all other Americans.  Denying gay partners the full benefits otherwise granted to same sex partners is saying that gay individuals and same-sex couples are \u00e2\u0080\u009csecond-class citizens\u00e2\u0080? who may, under the law, be treated differently from, and less favorably than, heterosexual individuals or opposite-sex couples.  On this basis, several state courts have decided it was illegal to deny same sex couples the right to marry. So, the question is not \"should Gay marriage be legal in the United State of America?\" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way toward same sex couples. Obviously, the answer is \"No\".",

Liberty (cf. freedom, personal liberty)   3. the pursuit of Happiness (cf. personal fulfillment, professional accomplishment, basic comforts, human pleasures, luxuries, vices)   So? Who are you? Who are they? I can find just as many people (more probably) who disagree with you. Who says your morals are better than theirs?   OK I do agree with you here morality can be subject to opinion but in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it does say:   All human beings are born free and  equal  in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of  brotherhood .     Everyone  is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.   It is only because of the time when this was written that it does not state Sexuality as it was written in 1948 and Homosexuality has only become legal in most countries since the 70's.   Again, says who? All of these rights and guaranteed freedoms are nice to talk about, but they just don't exist   See first right from Declaration. OK I agree again with you that the specifics are vague and do not include marriage, in countries where Gay marriage is legal those people have their rights.   Yes. This is actually what I mean when I said the argument had degraded. The descent into name calling was very immature. Most of my very best friends are gay and I take real offense to comments like these.   It was because of the name calling that I got involved in the first place, as I have said before it is everyones right to religious beliefs and I believe that if they want to go about celebrating their beliefs then that is OK too, where it stops being OK is when they try to use their scriptures to affect laws in secular societies by demonising Homosexuals and trying to change the attitudes of the people. I also have gay friends and family and I coming from a strict Roman Catholic house have witnessed the devastating effect these beliefs can have on a persons mentality and general well-being, there is a friend of the family that was beaten so badly for being Gay that he had to move away.   No, I'm using the logic of something you believe to be wrong to show you how religious people feel. Did you know that many religions believe homosexual acts are only one step down from murder?   There is no logic in the equation as the two are far from equal, murder robs people of their dignity, right to life and robs families of loved ones and causes nothing but pain it is a heinous act. Homosexuality creates no victim or pain or loss of dignity, etc.   Many religions believe God destroys whole cities if they permit homosexuality. But more importantly, this is an attempt to put you in their shoes and show one reason why they have a right to vote to make homosexual marriage illegal.   Many people don't and religious people are entitled to vote just the same as everyone else, it would be that if they kept to this right and not infringe on the rights of others that their case could be respectfully considered. I can empathize with people from a religious community, I was one as a child, my own mother would rather die than give up her beliefs.   They have a right to vote their conscious, and it has everything to do with religion. Do you have a right to force your morality on them and have their tax dollars support something they find to be a crime next to murder?   Again I agree with you on the rights of everyone to vote. I have no right to force my morality on anyone, I am not trying to do that. What I was trying to get across was the fact that not all is known and what is known is constantly being questioned, religious texts can be interpreted to anyones avail, and it is proved that they are massively edited, the problem comes when secular societies and religious communities clash.   Surely if no-one is being hurt then there should be no problem, if religious people believe it is wrong then they should consider the fact that a civil union is not a religious one, and therefore void in the eyes of their creator.   As for the fear that God destroys cities that permit homosexuality, I believe you are referring to Sodom and Gomorrah, did God not remove his faithful from these cities before destroying them and did he not pledge that he would  \"never again curse the ground on account of man\"  after Noah's flood so there is nothing to fear.",

I have my father, my cousins, friends, and uncles all of whom I consider decent people and I'll make sure they can see all the types of lives in the spectrum. No study has shown that children raised by gay parents have more problems with gender roles or sexuality than those raised by straight couples. The only negative impact I can see is a child getting picked on for it but a) that is not the parents' fault but the society's and b) kids will always find something to make fun of because they are kids. It's what happens and, to an extent, it builds strength when paired with love from others.

Children have the right to be raised by a mother and father.\"   This has nothing do with kids. Nothing in proposition 8 affected education or adoption. It was all lies and propaganda.  Another gem in that video. \"We need to protect religious freedoms.\" So how does forcing everyone else to abide by your religion protect religious freedom? That seems a bit bassackwards to me.  Your religion was the main source of funds behind this campaign and all of these advertisements. Please I beg you, try to really think critically about all of this.",

    "context": "Wow. A contradictory statement within the same breath? What do you mean when you say \"homosexuals are not wrong\"?   It is contradicting. However, my argument still stands correct. Before i go ahead, this is all opinionated and this is what i believe is the \"truth.\"   I thought it was clear when i stated that homosexuals are not wrong. What i meant was, in a simple perspective, that being a homosexual stops the advancement of human growth and advancement. This perspective is not being able to produce children.  The truth is contradicting. Evidence that supports the previous sentence is the fact that homosexuals stops the world from overpopulation. This is another perspective that makes being a homosexual naturally right. This evidence supports advancement of growth by controlling growth. That too sounds contradicting but if we overpopulated, then it may be hard to sustain life. If we can't sustain life, then we can't advance the growth of humans. Now, i am not too educated in all the problems that may happen due to overpopulation. However, i do think it is bad to use up most of earth's resources. We need earth's resources to sustain life.    Knowledge is simply belief on the basis of strong/over-whelming evidence. To say that you \"believe\" in anything in a debate amounts to saying nothing at all!   I understand what you are saying. However, you implied wrong. I believe that is this knowledge/truth because of the evidence that i gave in my first argument:   1. Fearing the tip blade touching our heart because we don't want to die. (lol i said blame)?   2. We go to school to better ourselves.   3. Not wasting my life playing on my Nintendo Wii if i had a billion dollars.   I believe morality plays a part of evidence that supports the purpose of life (I can be wrong about this) :  1. Killing one or multiple people of your own race, human race, is wrong. Why do we hate or cringe our face at the thought of killing one of our own? I believe (but i think it is face on some levels) that it is wrong because killing your own kind is against the purpose of life.   However, this is contradictory. This is contradictory because we had World War 1 and World War 2. We kill our own kind in that race. However, i think that the truth can be contradictory. We had to fight in World War 1 and World War 2 to sustain America's advancement of growth.......I not to intelligent in history. However, i believe one of the main reason to fight in war is to not let other people control us. Excuse me and correct me if I'm wrong.    How are any of these analogies related to whether homosexuals should or should not get married?   hmmm. I stated this before in another person's comment but i believe i went off topic with my entire comment. When shadowwolf stated that men and women should fall in love, i took it as that men and women should be attracted to one another. That is why i went into the discussion of children and the purpose of life. I went into that discussion because the purpose of life is supported when men and women have children. If the author of this debate didn't imply \"producing children\" to \"married\" then my argument should be dismissed entirely due to the fact that i went off topic.   I'm not realizing this mistake.",

It seems silly they would be allowed to ban others from it because it's their word (not their concept).   Also marriage is a lot more than a religious tradition nowadays; you can have many different churches preform a marriage, not all of them Christian, as you can the government through a courthouse. One acceptable option would to be to completely sever the link between church and state in this regard and stop giving financial benefits to married couples; then gays would only be denied something of religious significance.   Another viable option is for Christianity to change it's views, as it has done numerous times in the past, to allow gay marriage. Yet another alternative is for Christianity to allow the gays to form a splinter religion, as has been done numerous times in the past, and this similar and affiliated religion would be able to sanction gay marriage.   In conclusion: Christians didn't invent marriage, it's not their business to police it. If they want to police it, the state shouldn't compensate and reward them for their efforts. If they still want tax breaks and financial aid, they need to drag themselves out of the stone age yet again, or otherwise allow gay churches to preform their own gay marriages, if they really want nothing to do with it.",

I am now going to tell you why I don't want gay marriage in my country:  1. Family - anything that goes against a mother and a father being the only definition of a family is going against the constitution, what this country was founded on and nature. We are in every way created to be with the opposite sex.  2. Homosexuality is abnormal. Most people are not gay. The media trains people to think the opposite. People are laterally being brainwashed. That is never good.  3. It goes against my beliefs. And I have a right to those beliefs.",

Same sex couples are allowed to adopt and we are singled out by the US as gay parents and our children are also being discriminated against by NOT giving us the full benefits of marrige. I believe that our children should be recognized as being part of a family. A family is love and who in the hell has the right to say who and what anyone can love. You are taking our right to love away.   The children of same sex families need to feel equal and same sex couples need equality so that we can feel secured as an American Family shoud. We are not asking for anything more than what anyone else has. We are not asking for special privledges. We just want to be treated equally.   Our children have the right to have a sence of belonging without any predjudices. We pay taxes, we are your Doctors, teachers , police officers, servicemen, freinds, neighbors, brothers, sisters, Mothers, Fathers, Bankers, and some of us are even in the military protecting this country!!! We are everywhere and we are not going away. We are only coming out stronger and in more numbers. Hiding in the closet is not an option any longer!  We as Americans desearve equality!!!!  I have one question: If we are not able to recieve full equal benefits of marrige(ie.. survivor benefits), would it be correct to say that we should be exempt from paying taxes since this does not benefit the gay communtiy. I mean come on, why should we pay into social security if we are not able to cash in on our full benefits? Mabey we should get a tax break?? i guess our gay money is good enough to take but we, as gay americans are not worthy to have it work for us when we need it!!!   The worst thing about this is that the federal government is judging us and if I remeber correctly, GOD is the only one to judge me! Rememeber , GOD made us equal and in his vision.",

And like i said above, i will prove that again.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ---   Two contradictory statements:   Homosexuals does not support the purpose of life by not producing children    Homosexuality do support the purpose of life by stopping overpopulation   However, they are both correct.   The purpose of life to advance as humans. One way to advance as humans is to grow in numbers.   Scenario 1. If you have a civilization with mostly female homosexuals, how can that society continue to grow where there is no future citizens? When we read history textbooks, it is filled with the desire to grow and conquer as one society. If this such society existed, homosexuality is wrong.   Scenario 2. If a civilization is on the edge of overpopulation, that spell problems for the society. One problem is the fear that all of society's resources is going to be used up. Resources share a help in sustaining society growth: wood, fire, paper, food, etc. If homosexuality existed in that civilization, then overpopulation has a greater chance than normal of not being met. In this case, homosexuality is right.   When i say homosexuality is wrong and right. I don't mean that they are totally wrong and totally right. They share a right and wrong like non-homosexual people; like any normal person.   When i review both contradicting statments individually, they are both truthful. A person can be both \"right\" AND \"wrong\" at the same time. If i murdered Adolf Hitler, im wrong for taking a life. However, im right for saving the Jewish people from cruel torment. Though, i don't really know about that if taking down Hitler would stop the Jewish people from suffering. There were many factors that led to their safety.   I believe a better example is murdering a rapist who is trying to rape a person. If i killed that rapists, i killed a person. I am thus, wrong. However, i am also right for saving a life.   --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- -----   Look at China. They feared of overpopulation. Therefore, they proposed the \"one child policy.\" I think that acts like a Homosexuality Act where couples can't produce more than one child. I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.",

I know homosexuality and the policy is totally similiar BUT it does share similarities. The policy states, basically, that urban married couples are restricted to having only one child. Also, there are exemption to rural married couples. (source: wikipedia).    http://www.prb.org/Articles/2006/ ChinasConcernOverPopulationAgingandHeal th.aspx    The link i provide is interesting because this show that China is now fearing of having too fewer children to support due to the fast againstof its people.",

In fact, this right actually IS a right, whereas marriage is nowhere in the constitution and not guaranteed to anyone. Don't like it? Change it! That is your right!",

If your raised by one parent, and they bring home 80,000 a year by working just 4 hours a day(lets say their good with stocks), then lets say this person spends considerable time with their children; maybe he/she home schools them or something. That person would still be providing a good home, because the material, emotional and developmental needs of their children would be meet. If later this person gets into a good relationship, either with a member of the same sex or not; then the child needs would be even better supplied; and lets say this couple then wants to make it a triple and bring in a third person; even better for the kid right? This benefit continues for awhile, but eventually the needs of the group would overcome the means of supply; which means the group would become splintered(but still connected) and function more like a tribe then a family. Even that wouldn't be bad for the kid though, \"it takes a village to raise a child\".  Some homosexual couples adopt. gay marriage would allow for people to pool resources together better because of the financial incentives, meaning more stable families being more capable of adopting which would lessen the burden on foster care. There are many incentives to invest in homosexual marriage, i haven't came close to touching all of them here.",

I see the gay community's fight for gay marriage as an uphill battle   I believe  you are right . I think the battle to get civil unions is not only a compromise that will still end up maintaining at least some semantic distinction between gay couples and heterosexual couples who will still say married, etc. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think it is actually more of an uphill battle rather than an easier one. As I tried to explain in my argument above, to institute civil unions nationwide, you would have to go through the entire US Code and replace all references to marriage, with civil unions. Additionally, you would likely still have to fight in every single state to get the laws changed to recognize those unions. Even treaties that deal with recognition of US marriages overseas would likely be affected, and who knows what else. Repealing DOMA would allow just one state to legalize gay marriage and all other states would recognize it like they do the marriages that take place in other states today.   The only reason not to use the word marriage is to appease bigots who somehow find the idea of two people loving each other unbearable if those two people happen to have the same naughty parts.  I think past compromises like don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell intentionally left policy in an inherently unmaintainable state that is bound to be overturned in the future and therefore had a modicum of acceptability, but civil unions do not possess that attribute as prominently and would only be reconsidered if that semantic difference grew into something more.

How am I conflating description with definition when I am talking about the order of something?   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to tolerate it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   I do want to force you to tolerate it? Wow! maybe I'm wrong but that doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.  You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent. Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone. Maybe you should be more open minded to the fact that they might not be morally equivalent.   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just is.    You wouldn't say it's a good thing? You just said that racial integration was a good thing and gay marriage is it's moral equivalent. So how is that not saying this is a good thing if this a part of gay marriage?    Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives. Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good. Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude.   Sorry, Loss of hope leads to depression and depression leads to suicide. Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   See when you tell someone they are born gay and can't change; you shut the door on them and say there is no way out; you seal their fate and condemn them to death.  I however throw the door open and say; your behavior doesn't define you, you can change and there are thousands who have. That's hope and that saves lives.   Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.   Oh there it is, the myth of neutrality and genetic fallacy all rolled in one. Nice job jesseald! Facts are annoying things aren't they? But waving the magic wand of neutrality doesn't make them go away. And neither does disparaging the source of those facts.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   Let me see if I understand you.   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.   So what do ya do with all those people who change their behavior? And why are you trying to persuade me to change my behavior towards homosexuality.  Wow! So you are a fatalist. DNA is destiny right? Oh wait, were is that gene? what they can't find it! darn.  By making this argument you deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul). Your argument therefore assumes naturalism. Oh but wait, your argument is full of moral judgments and thoughts. Darn! those abstract realities always mess things up.",

How am I conflating description with definition when I am talking about the order of something?   Accept it? No, I don't think you will ever accept it. Your mind is closed. But I do want to force you to tolerate it. We forced racial integration onto people who didn't want it, and that was a good thing. We should force gay marriage onto people for similar reasons.   I do want to force you to tolerate it? Wow! maybe I'm wrong but that doesn't sound like toleration or freedom. It sounds more like tyranny.  You assume that racial integration and gay marriage are morally equivalent. Please tell me how judging the color of ones skin is equivalent to judging the behavior of someone. Maybe you should be more open minded to the fact that they might not be morally equivalent.   I wouldn't say it's a good thing. It just is.    You wouldn't say it's a good thing? You just said that racial integration was a good thing and gay marriage is it's moral equivalent. So how is that not saying this is a good thing if this a part of gay marriage?    Are you honestly suggesting a large number of people should repress their sexuality for their entire lives?   Yes, just like thieves and murderers should repress their desires for their entire lives. Some behaviors are detrimental to civilization and should be restrained for the greater good. Just ask the Roman Empire what happens when you let homosexuality be freely expressed.   Problems such as depression and suicide are caused by a lack of tolerance, and we should work to change society's attitude.   Sorry, Loss of hope leads to depression and depression leads to suicide. Telling people the are born gay and can't change kills hope for someones who's conscience is troubled.   See when you tell someone they are born gay and can't change; you shut the door on them and say there is no way out; you seal their fate and condemn them to death.  I however throw the door open and say; your behavior doesn't define you, you can change and there are thousands who have. That's hope and that saves lives.   Also, American Physicians and Surgeons is a political organization. I'm sure you know that as well as I do. If you want to have an honest debate, cite neutral third parties.   Oh there it is, the myth of neutrality and genetic fallacy all rolled in one. Nice job jesseald! Facts are annoying things aren't they? But waving the magic wand of neutrality doesn't make them go away. And neither does disparaging the source of those facts.   Can't be done. Homosexuality is not a choice.   Let me see if I understand you.   Homosexuality is a behavior, we don't choose our behaviors therefore you can't be free from bad behaviors.   So what do ya do with all those people who change their behavior? And why are you trying to persuade me to change my behavior towards homosexuality.  Wow! So you are a fatalist. DNA is destiny right? Oh wait, were is that gene? what they can't find it! darn.  By making this argument you deny the moral component in play and therefore deny the existence of a moral agent (a soul). Your argument therefore assumes naturalism. Oh but wait, your argument is full of moral judgments and thoughts. Darn! those abstract realities always mess things up.",

Why not check for yourself? I don't know why but Christians I talk to never seem to want to actually check the bible. If you do look, notice how each banning of homosexuality is nearby something you certainly don't follow. For example, Leviticus bans homosexuality and wearing clothes made of multiple fabrics. Jesus does say that \"dogs\" don't get into heaven, but also includes anyone that's ever told a lie. This kind of thing occurs at every reference to homosexuality, believe me, I checked. Why is it you are happy to ignore all these details? Obviously because they are silly. But why then don't you view the homosexuality stuff as silly? Misleading representatives of the church I suspect that are trying to spread their own personal preferences, in the same way the bible was recently used to defend slavery.\"     If a man also lies with a man, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

But you are close to the truth, which is that men sexually attracted to other men is a type of sexual orientation.  And speaking of being disoriented, you argue that same sex attraction is not a choice, but \"correcting that behavior\" is a choice. You want to \"treat the condition\".   All such \"treatments\" to date have been found by reputable scientists as less than worthless -- they are actually harmful. So, until there is a \"cure\" that is not harmful, and until gay folk decide they want to think of themselves as defective and in need of being fixed, then we ought to just get out of the way and join all the other countries in the world that permit same-sex marriage.",

If you want money in life and you work to get it, and this is what makes you happy you are entitled to that. This is a right that you have, unfortunately a homosexual person in some parts of the world has no right to carry out their lives with the same dignity and respect awarded to a financial wizard.   Who says they're out-dated? Because you disagree they are out of date?   I do and so does a lot of other people, the fact of the matter is that some of the morals thought in a lot of religious texts are odious and out of line with modern understanding of humanity and our nature.   If person x believes God says gay sex is wrong, why would that change over any number of years?   It probably will not but the question is about Gay marriage and not sex.    Your dispute is that you don't believe God says that, but doesn't everyone have a right to religious freedom   Whether or not God said anything is irrelevant and i don't believe in God so I don't believe he said anything. Everyone has the right to religious freedom, a freedom granted that they respect other peoples rights and freedoms as well, including those of homosexuals to get married in a civil ceremony, one that does not involve any religious denomination, beliefs or rules.   And is it bigoted to say being gay is bad?If you believe fornication (sex out of marriage) is wrong, you believe that in all cases. If you believe gay sex is wrong you believe that in all cases. Does that make someone a bigot?   No, but it becomes so when you go out of your way to label and abuse Gay people.(The following are examples from the argument you are talking about)   You can call them butt-buddies, scissor-partners, bumchums etc. etc. but don't call them a married couple.    I need to come up with a new accurate word to describe you queers    Anyway cockmuncher........you're gay.    Faggot.   Tell me if this is the reasoning of a religious person or a bigot.   I'd be willing to believe you think murder is wrong in all cases, does that make you a bigot?   Are you seriously equating murder with homosexuality?   You are both arguing two separate points because you have two different life views.   Is this not the point?   While one of you is probably right, it does not necessarily mean that the other is stupid or bigoted to believe in something different.   Like I have said belief is everyones right and I am not in the business of disputing that, but it is not the right of the religious to force their opinions on any one especially when it has nothing to do with religion.",

Religious people regard their marriage as a bond put together by their God as this is not the case of Homosexual marriage why would it matter, as they will be judged by whichever God the religious person is prescribing to, which should make them more comfortable with it as they should know that punishment will be served.

Why should they have to hide and you not?    But sitting their justifying their sinful acts is disgraceful and disgusting.   It is a pity you feel this way as I guess it is only going to become easier for Gay people to go about their lives as straight people do.   My last point on this farcical debate is that Homosexuals getting married in a civil ceremony and being viewed only legally should not enrage the religious. Religious people regard their marriage as a bond put together by their God as this is not the case of Homosexual marriage why would it matter, as they will be judged by whichever God the religious person is prescribing to, which should make them more comfortable with it as they should know that punishment will be served. I do not believe in any God or follow any religion therefore the comments I just made are purely an appeal to logic.",

That is also what you liberals would call an \"arbitrary\" or \"capricious\" distinction.  Quite simply people of different races do not get together and they should \"get their own thing\". There's nothing wrong with the name Mixed Union when they are given the same legal entitlements as marriage (pure-race unions, or clean-marriages, of better defined as those marriages which are in keeping with our honourable forefathers of America).  Marriage is a precious institution of our society and only recently in the history of the US has the mixing of races within this great institution been permitted (research yourself how liberal and \"new\" this Mixed Union concept is). The other Great nations of the past also did not permit such mixings; even S. American nations (which do not count as one of those capital-G \"Great\" nations) until recently made explicit laws making sure that those Mixers would GET THEIR OWN THING instead of muddying up the definition of marriage. As other people later put it, and quite logically put it, 1+1 IS NOT 3, IT'S 2. THE ANSWER IS 2. Though, of course, one would argue the real answer is to this problem is 42... anyone with me?  1 Latino + 1 Pure Aryan = DOES NOT MAKETH A MARRIAGE; it makes it a Mixed Union entitled to all the same legal protections as marriage. We do make this extremely precious and important distinction because nowadays our dictionaries are getting muddied with upstart liberal ideas (my god, they want to redefine sexuality and say that men have sex with men... and the women, the pure women as well! it's just inconceivable). For the sacred, time-honored tradition of protecting our dictionaries, we make that important legal distinction.  Yes, that's exactly why we are so passionate about arguing for the non-arbitrary distinction between real marriage and Mixed Unions. We are concerned that 1+1 is not 3, and we are also concerned about the muddying of our dictionaries. And since Mixed Unions have the same legal entitlements as real marriages, my lawyer told me that it does not constitute discrimination and that those liberals are likely to fail at a challenge in the courts. Suckers! Shoulda hired better lawyers, you Mixers!  Oh wait, we're talking about those gay people. Yeah, suckers, you Civil Unioners. I won't call you by your real name, but you know what name I'm thinking for you when I think of you... you non-marriage Unioners!  Separate but equal is just as equal as surely as 2 = 2 or x = x.  btw, with more convincing logic, if a = b and b = x, then a = x. See? Different, yet equal. wow. just wow.",

And as I said even though past oppression may have been worse, it does not take away from the oppression now. But you failed to respond to that point, typically.  No everything in that video is not true. Proposition 8 had nothing to do with schools or children. As I said in another recent post, under California law parents can remove their children from any health or family lesson. Proposition 8 did not even mention kids or adoption or education.   \"In a democracy if the majority believe that something is wrong then it is fair. The minority can get over it or move to another country.\"   Once again you demonstrate your complete lack of understanding of the Constitution. If you had a true or false question, \"Is America based on majority rules?\", the answer would be false. The system is set up with majority rules and minority rights with the latter not being an afterthought. The founders specifically set it up that way to avoid the kind of oppression that they experienced in Great Britain. The majority does not have the legal right to oppress the minority. Morally I strongly disagree with you that the oppressed minority should just \"get over it or move to another country.\" Should the slaves have just gotten over it? But of course morals are opinions so neither of us is right. Legally, however, you couldn't be more incorrect.",

This is good stuff ;)  So, the question is not \"should farm subsidies be legal in the United State of America?\" but should we continue to allow the government to continue to act in a discriminatory way towards non farmers. Obviously, the answer is \"No\".  This is easy! Why didn't I think of this before? ;)  But you know, it might be easier to just go after the benefits and maybe try to force the government to stop using the word marriage. That way you'll only have the government to deal with, not the government AND the religious right.   The gay community is fighting two fronts.

Basically what I'm saying is that the way gays have been going about fighting for their rights recognizes the opposition's right to say \"no.\"  Now, I agree with and support this:  3. The term \"marriage\" could be removed from state and/or federal laws, turning all \"marriages\" into civil unions in the eyes of the government. PLUS, same-sex civil unions would need to be recognized in all 50 states or at the federal level.  I don't support number one because it means that the rights of the opponents of same sex marriages are being trampled on and they will therefore fight back. In other words, it legitimizes their right to oppose same sex marriage and gives them reason to fight back.  I would fight against number two because I'm for states rights. The federal government has way too much power.  Now, I did not say that gays are unreasonable for wanting same sex marriage. I am saying that if they are trying to follow scenarios one and two above, they are being unreasonable in the way they are pursuing it.   The argument that \"it doesn't affect any straight couple\" doesn't work because anyone could say, \"And? So what? Who cares? The majority has voted. They don't want it!\"  The whole \"African-Americans and other minorities \"forced\" their way into predominately white institutions, and clearly weren't wanted\" doesn't work because the word marriage has a religious aspect to it that needs to be separated from the legal aspect. If it can't be removed, then another word needs to take its place.  You ask, \"What gives them the right to deny those who want to pursue happiness with the one they love, legal sanction to do so?\" The answer is: Anyone who bothers to argue with someone who denies them the pursuit of happiness gives that person the right to do so. By arguing the point you are admitting/recognizing their right to oppose you. If your stance is that they have no right to oppose you, then you need not argue the point; you just figure a way to navigate the system or go around the system.  Now, lets see how ridiculous you sound when you say that gays have never been able to find an ounce of happiness because they don't have a piece of paper that says that they are legally married. What a bunch of crap. Do you actually expect me to believe that a piece of paper is going to magically make them find happiness? Come on.  Gays have been living together, spending the rest of their lives together, loving each other, expressing their love for each other in front of friends and family for ages. If you think that a piece of paper is going to somehow make things any different, think again. Those people who hate gays will always hate gays regardless of this piece of paper you so desperately want.",

If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be).   But I do think you raised an interesting point. It would be intriguing to hear from a child who is raised by gay parents, or from an adult who was raised by gay parents.

The only way to ensure the right of homosexuals to marry would be to get an amendment passed. This would be virtually impossible though because there is still a lot of homophobia in the U.S. Also Church's, like the Mormon Church, encouraged their members to donate money and vote for Prop 8.

It's not the word they object to...it's the entire concept. Your analogy of the homeless guy needing a bed to sleep in is about as demented as you are.   Joe, I don't give a twaddle if you agree with me on any issue but the one thing you're wrong about is that I ever expected you to share my views nor do I expect that from anyone here or in my life. That's not friendship, that's being a puppet at someone else's whim. Being a friend Joe means that one must choose words carefully when you know that the other person is offended or hurt by the subject matter. You don't make a joke about it, at the very least! Think about what I said on the debate when that person was looking for your retirement from this site. I said what I did because it was wrong and you were my ally even though I was still bruised from the last brouhaha regarding Repubgal. You were so busy trying to think of unfunny things to say you couldn't think for one moment that I may have needed some words of encouragement from you on that board! And another thing....you seem to think you have to accept MY decision to relegate you to the cheap seats and name you an enemy. I don't need your permission to do that and I don't care if you like it or not.   And if you're going to quote the Serenity Prayer, why don't you try and get it right. Perhaps the real prayer will mean more than Joe's version of it. It goes like this Boffo:  God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and Wisdom to know the difference.  I don't need to feel better but perhaps you do. I can only hope that someday you can comprehend its meaning.",

By bringing this issue to the courts, the homosexual community is forcing a rule onto a private group! it is written in the christian rule set (of any form or branch of the following of Jehovah (Yes, that is His name), including Catholics, Jews, Mormans, ect.) that the bond of two souls of the same sex is unnatural, and as such is immoral. So here remains the issue; the Christians are upset because the homosexual community is FORCING, and not just by judicial means, their beliefs of unity onto another private party. It is written by the way in the most used from of the bible that it is an absolute sin to propose, follow threw, or allow a marriage of the same two sex's.   Keep in mind that i am not christian, but follow a similar religion that, while against the order of unnatural ethics, am for the furthering of the bondage of souls, and also believe that every soul finds it's way into each beast and its sex's.   The best speech i can think of to this subject is the episode of South Park when Big Gay Al was kicked out of the Boy Scouts for being openly gay.

Yes, I was using hyperbole to make a point. If we stretch the legal definition of marriage to cover a groups preference what's to stop another group from demanding that it be stretched to cover their preference? Were it ends then becomes an arbitrary standard. And if you don't set one, the thing gets so stretched that it hardly resembles what it first look liked.  Just for the sake of humor:   consent is not a passive action, but an active one. It requires that there is a fulfilling of some verbal criteria, whether written or spoken, and it has to be initiated within the strictures of the ritual.   Me and my cat had a ritual; it actively walked up to the alter in my apartment were I was kneeling and meowed and I respond back with \"I love you too\" we rubbed noses and I said till death do we part.

Now, the goverment gives many benefits economically, tax wise, etc to married couples. [2] The reason they only give them to traditional couples is because of their ability to procreate. Having children is the only way to continue society and advance our culture and race. As the heterosexual couples are the only people who can advance society in this way, and well pay back the benefits they get through marriage, then they deserve a state recognition. The goverment makes laws based of of interests, and their interest in this case is procreation. Therefore allowing gay marriage would be unjust as it debars the special recognition the heterosexual couples deserve.  People who are pro gay marriage usually have the claims that marriage is about love, but this is far from true. If marriage is about love, then why is the state involved? They are involved due to some sort of interest. If the goverment cared about love, then they would attempt to regulate and control friendships or non marital relationships.  The reason they regulate marriage over these other relationships is because marriage is where you are meant to produce a larger workforce. The reason they do not regulate other relationships is because they have no good reason to do so, at all.  The goverment in marriage needs two things: 1) legal commitment, 2) procreation and the ability to raise a child. A boyfriend girlfriend relationship may produce offspring in the process, but as they are not legally binding situation it is easier for them to break apart, and they will not be able to raise the child. A homosexual relationship will be lacking the legal bind, and the ability to produce offspring. Even if we did give them a legal bind, they would not be able to create children therefore not fulfilling the states interest fully.  One argument used against the procreation argument is the infertile argument. This objection is a misunderstood rebuttal, they do not understand the debate at point. The argument is not fully based of of the ability to reproduce, but rather a type of relationship in which procreation is possible to start off. It is not an argument fully based of of the argument they can make kids, but also an argument based of of the ability to have the similar effect, a procreative type union.  My opponent without a doubt will start to argue as marriage has benefits isn't it fair homosexuals receive them too? Any society, goverment, or institution that distinguishes marriage in a certain way will prohibit some types of marriage. A prohibition of SSM does not violate the equal protection clause as we must first have a definition of what marriage is. You cannot confirm that a SSM ban is unconstitutional unless we determine exactly what marriage is, and what it is for. [3]  It is only unconstitutional if they are unjustly debarred the right. Ex: Is it unconstitutional if we debar a murderer from a gun? No. That is a just cause, and with my secular case against gay marriage I have proven they are justly debarred the right. By saying it is unconstitutional you are saying it discriminates without just cause, and that this group deserves the right. As murderers do not deserve a right to a gun, then it is constitutional. In the states eyes homosexual couples cannot produce offspring therefore do not fulfill states interest, and do not deserve the right.  Just because something may have inherent good effects does not mean they deserve the legal benefits. The challenge to my opponent, and the argument he needs to press is: What are the states interest in giving these couples rights? If the State has no reason to give you benefits then why should they? Marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, and no one else, and the states interest is in a procreative type relationship, a gay couple does not entitle to these benefits.  Last statement:  1.\" Heterosexual union is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).  2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.  3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.  4. Civil ordinances which recognize gay marriage as comparable to heterosexual marriage constitute a rejection of the special value of heterosexual unions.  5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.  6. Therefore, gay marriage is unjust.\"[1]   http://wisdomandfollyblog. com/2008/10/02/ an-argument-against-gay-marriage/     http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/ marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html    Sherif Girgis, Robert P.

By this, I mean that I don't think he will become a serial killer or schizophrenic or anything based solely on the fact that his parents are of the same sex. I have heard that there have been tests on this sort of thing, and gay couples children have turned out to be just about 'normal.' Perhaps, if the child is female, and her parents are both male, she will turn out to be more masculine than the average girl, but what is wrong with that? I also believe that if her two parents are both very feminine, she will turn out to be 'normal.' So, it is not so much the gender of the parents, but their personalities that mold the child. In this country, many hetero parents with children get divorces, or one of the parents dies, and it is then legal for only the mother/father to raise the child on their own. So, if having either no mother/father figure screws up a child, shouldn't raising a child on your own be illegal for as long as gay adoption is?  Also, don't most, or at least some, adopted babies come from third world countries where they will end up living their lives in poverty, violence, and probably no parents if they are not adopted? I don't understand why anyone would want to see a child raised this way instead of with two men who will love and care for them. It makes me sick.",

To say...that 24 weeks is the cutoff time is wrong. But then...tell me cattiscus...is abortion wrong? And just to let you know.....without intervention no baby could survive birth without help. One who is born earlier than 40 weeks just might need additional help.  Who are you to say...that poverty would be that childs life? Look at the poor people you would have exterminated in order to save them from a life you find pathetic. There are many poor people who are happy.

He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood and that any interruption at any point throughout this time constitutes a termination of human life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I am no more prepared to say that these early stages of development in the womb represents an incomplete human being than I would be to say that prior to the dramatic effects of puberty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.is not a human being. This is human life at every stage.\u00e2\u0080?  Dr Jerome LeJeune, professor of genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris France. He is the doctor who discovered the chromosome pattern of Down syndrome. He says\u00e2\u0080? after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. This is no longer a matter of taste or opinion and not a metaphysical contention; it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning at conception.\u00e2\u0080?  Professor Hymie Gordon, Mayo Clinic: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception.\u00e2\u0080?

You're older than me, probably a few steps closer to making your own children than I am. Is your life worth more than mine? Surely you must think so.

I am much more capable of creating life than a fetus. I have much more potential at this time. Sure, the fetus has the potential to one day be like me, but right now it is not. That means it's worth less right? Is it o.k. to abort millions of un-born children but not o.k. to kill me?   No?

It is ok to wear a condom. any such person being stopped from existing is just hypothetical. A fetus isnt a person, it is a human being. however just what the hell is a person? abortion gets down to questions that have been disputed for hundreds of years, and to this day don't possess satisfactory answers.   A fetus is undeniably alive by the way, it just doesn't demonstrate sapience and can not. Expanding the scope of the argument leads to problems, showing that the argument from sapience is only valid with \"but\", \"ifs\" etc which would contradict the argument. Is a baby born less then one day ago really sapient? if not, why not be able to put it in a dumpster. It does not have a choice of its own, and does not seem very \"person\" like. Thus it fits the criteria and people should have the ability to kill it, for it is very dependent on a care taker(s) and what right does it have to impose on anyone?

Everybody thinks that abortion is wrong, but most of those people even haven't been pregnant. It is easier to talk about it and to say that women shouldn't have an abortion, but when it happens it is very hard to make a choice.   When people talk about abortion and say that it is wrong, they judge women who had an abortion. We cannot judge people.   Abortion is not very good, of course. But it is not wrong. It is a choice. It is a choice of those women who cannot take responsibility for children because of some reasons.   For example, just imagine, you are a 16 years old girl who just found out that she is pregnant. You have no husband, your boyfriend said that it is your problem. Your family has no money to take care for your child and you even haven't finished a school yet. What would you do? Do you want to break your life and life of your child just because people told you that abortion is a sin and it is wrong? I don't think so. You would think, even for a minute you would think about abortion.  What would I do in that situation? Of course, I would think a lot. But if my situation was very very bad, I would have an abortion, I think. Of course, I would never forget about that. And when I grew up and became an adult with a work, with a husband and with money I would adopt a child. I can explain why.   Abortion is a murder. I agree with that. But everybody has a right to be wrong. Everybody makes mistakes. And we shouldn't afraid to make them. We should fix our mistakes. It is called a responsibility, if you do something wrong, fix it. We should use this rule everywhere, as well with abortion. As I said earlier, abortion is a murder. And how to fix a murder? If you killed a child, give a life for another child. It is a solution for that.  How to fix other problems? For example, if you stole $1000, give somebody $1000. If you broke a tree, plant a new tree. If you messed up a book in a library, apologize and buy them a new book. And I said, if you killed someone, give a life for someone.   So, I can say that all of us make mistakes, we are not perfect. Nobody does. But we have to think without emotions and to fix our mistakes.   Of course, if woman has capabilities to take care for the child, it it better not to have an abortion but to give a life for him.  But if woman decided not to have a child, it is not wrong.  It is not good, but not wrong.]",

And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates\u00e2\u0080\u00a6when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I have faith in Him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you do some heavy research on this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.blah blah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.   Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least.   So because I believe woman have the right to abortion I no longer have feelings. I feel empathy and sympathy, it's hardly mind boggling that a human being as emotion towards other peoples negative experiences. Stop word twisting.   My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way   It's funny you'd repost my statement that abortion is a distressing thing to go through and then claim I want abortion to be seen positively. Consistence in the key in debating. Something you clearly don't have.   Tell me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I am allowed to change my mind\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..are you?   Yes and yes. I never denied this fact so I guess I'll just answer the first two questions. You can change your mind all you like it's no concern to me and I never claimed it to be. I'm allowed to change my mind, I probably won't on this topic though.   What you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. but then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perfect remember?   No I'm not. I'm saying don't judge people on actions you have taken yourself. Again I'm aware of the consequences of abortion. Are you aware of the consequences of having a child you never wanted? Explain to me exactly when I have judged someone and acted arrogantly? Thanks for calling me perfect all the time. I don't believe it myself but you seem to for some odd reason.   When you make a huge mistake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.if you have children don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them?   I protect my child and I will teach her the obvious stranger dangers e.c.t. But I'm not going to tell her to never have a friendship in case they fall out and she gets upset. I won't tell her to never have a relationship in case they break up. A lot of things hurt people you can't lock them up in a box and hope they never socialize. If my daughter was ever pregnant I'd help her. If she asks for the pros and cons I will tell her. If she asks me what to do I will say 'darling, whatever you feel is best for you'. Why? Because her happiness is the most important thing to me.   Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6good should have overcome evil, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.   People stood by and did nothing in the holocaust because they were scared. And people did do something hence there was a war because people rose to fight the injustice. They didn't  let  Jews get gassed. Everyone participated? That's a wild claim to make. Most people in the world did not participate and a lot objected and acted upon that.   Oh my goodness don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I was not a child when I had it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.   Did I say you were?   I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok.   And I'm arrogant. Stop calling me perfect, I'm blushing.   I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and have a blessed life.   Great. I have a wonderful child to. This means nothing to the debate subject. And being with same man isn't an accomplishment. It's a choice.    I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard.   You aborted but have the right to tell other woman they can't? Or that they're like Hitler? That they are murderers? Come off your high horse..   Distraught about what?   Having an abortion, derp.   how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong?   It is a horrible experience. My morals don't tell me it's wrong in all circumstances.    Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horrendous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Anyone who does not see one and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horrendous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Abortion is horrible, I've seen many. (The nursing and midwife studies might have resulted to this being true). It's not cold, uncompassionate and empty. You yourself said it's emotionless. How can it be empty then? I'm a bad person even though I assist in saving lives during pregnancy and child birth? Do you know how many unborn and born babies lives nurses and midwifes save? And because we choose abortion to be okay you think we are heartless murderers?    What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young?    Of course abortion is upsetting for a child. The word 'kid' kind of dictates a young age? I thought that was common knowledge.   I told my kids when they were teenagers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not selfish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6its real life and it happens.   So they weren't children....   Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me?    Abortion of a sibling effects someone personally. Watching south park doesn't.   LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with   Well I listed the names so you if you don't believe fact that is your ignorance. Of course I have problem with racism.   You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch\u00e2\u0080\u00a6shows. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life   No you  think  I am pro abortion. I know I'm not. I am neutral if anything. I don't deceive myself into anything, you want to believe I am so you can preach. Even if I was it doesn't make my opinion wrong and yours right. I stand up for life especially those already born. I stand up for a woman's life and her choice to abort for a start.   . I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I    No you are demeaning an opinion because it differs to yours. Because you don't like my opinion you assume I am an awful person.    You condone murder\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I never called you a racist   You said I had the same opinion as Hitler and Margaret who are racist. So yes you did.   I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.you are judging me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6   No you're not. You are trying to warp my opinion and claim I am a bad person because of it. Your opinion is not  right  to everyone. Just because you believe something doesn't make it the truth. You just offend people by dismissing anything they say. You haven't exposed me. My opinion is the same and your debates don't make me even think about changing it. I never judged you on the basis of your abortion opinion.   I point out what you say that are untruths    They're not untruths, you believe they are. Just because you don't agree doesn't make them wrong.   Why do you quote a book you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in?   Not once have I quoted the Bible. Perhaps say when? Didn't think you could...   You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.live with it accept the label take it as your own.   Again your opinion is not fact. You  think  I am pro-abort it doesn't make it true.    I am not however handing my posts in to be graded\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I live a full life and when I get on here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper \u00e2\u0080\u00a6.it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and explains what I said all along\u00e2\u0080\u00a6why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.or 24 weeks when obviously it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.",

Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him   No, no, no. If he is considered on ALL grounds then if he wants and abortion and she doesn't then his opinion counts and his vote for abortion could go ahead.   And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective?   You also called me a sissy? Sissy is actually considered homophobic by a lot of people. It's not an adjective. Brush up on your English language. It makes no difference if I said you're like a smelly tramp it's no nicer than saying you are a smelly tramp.   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   I'm a fully fledged adult. It is not the truth it's your opinion. And I'm arrogant yet your  feelings  have to be the truth?   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates\u00e2\u0080\u00a6when I have not.   Yay another list for me to make. Things you have said religiously to back your opinion:  He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs,  But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws.  But I love Christ more than any other person in the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I have faith in Him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved  I can't be bothered to go through your previous debates but you have mentioned religion a lot more than this.   You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and makes you look like you have no class.    No, a swear word is a word. It means nothing. Oh look another insult to me. Why thank you very much. And I'm not 'classy' it's not something I can aspire to with all my tattoos!   Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..but will leave it with these two   I think a few re reads are in order here. Read their opinion and read mine. It's not even comparible.   Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you do some heavy research on this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts.   My education is nursing. I am going into midwifrey I can assure I need not much education on human biology and the facts of abortion. My opinion is what  you  think is heartless and cold. To many others it is acceptable and logic. Don't speak for the world  .    Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.   I'm not pro-abortion is should be considered as a last resort. And if the last resort is an abortion then I accept that. I don't champion killing, I don't tell anyone to abort and I don't abort myself. I just understand why people do.   Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6unless he is married and the courts order him to pay   Biology isn't sexist again I study it. The context in which you describe things is sexist. The truth is what you perceive it to be. The truth is never what  you  think. Yes he does. If I had a child unmarried knew the father but we weren't a couple he would still have to pay child support.   They both have sex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.blah blah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?   My fiance and I weren't married. He took responsibility. He admits he took the risk even though I was on contraception. Stop speaking for everyone not everyone shares your opinion.   Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see the evidence.    No you don't. You've posted 2 links from wikipedia that prove nothing and a link to a catholic website which I'm not even remotely going to listen to since it is there to create fear into becoming religious. I post genuine scientific evidence and have done throughout my debates. I use my evidence you use yours. Why does it matter?   Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.   Because my opinion differs to yours I'm uneducated? No, I have educated myself and come to a conclusion. You have come to a conclusion I'm not going to tell you your opinion is wrong it's an opinion. That's the difference between you and I, I can accept that my opinion isn't right for everyone. You're a forcer, you think that everyone  has  to share your opinion or they're a bad person. And educate yourself on world language bugger is a common word among adults in England.

I work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I live a full life and when I get on here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper \u00e2\u0080\u00a6.it would be correct.   Great, I study work and have a 8 month old. I still find it takes no more than an extra 5 minutes to type most things correctly.   You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6   I haven't lied once. You constantly lie, I pointed out every lie. All my scientific evidence I have posted with my debate. I don't want to count them but anyone who is reading can and will. I work in this field idiot. Nurse/midwife mean anything to you?   This is your worldview\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and explains what I said all along\u00e2\u0080\u00a6why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.   It doesn't explain anything. I said I value people I just don't love them unless they are my family or friends. I can't pretend to have feelings for a stranger who means little to me. I certainly would never love you. Worldwide love is mostly a religious belief. Since I have no belief in religion I feel what I feel is right. Don't feel sorry for me I'm so happy and fulfilled with my life.   Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   Huge difference. I haven't told you your opinion on abortion is wrong. You tell me I am heartless a murderer, cold, ignorant. I accept my opinion isn't fact you can't do that. You place no actual evidence just your opinion. Your opinion is NOT fact.   You said two things in your post\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Ever heard of reading? It will do your argument good. They feel pain at the beginning of the second trimester (around 12 weeks) and I think abortion should happen before that. Honestly, you liar, I said what about 30 times? 24 week abortions are wrong.   So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.or 24 weeks when obviously it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.  Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.   Yes it is 12-14 weeks. Like I said all along. What the hell are you talking about? I said all along abortions shouldn't be allowed at 24 weeks. I know my position. I swear because I want to. I like swearing it's as much as the human language as any other word. Yes I know when. The fetus feels pain at the beginning of the 2nd trimester, again I've said that all along.",

She has taste buds and has developed the sucking reflex. She is beginning to practice her swallowing too. Teeth buds have also begun to form, as well as fingernails and toenails. Her major organs, as well as her sex organs have formed and are developing steadily.

To say that you can kill a fetus at any stage in the pregnancy isn't right, but never allowing a women to do something specific to her own body also isn't right.   Why do I say that? Well, simple: humans cannot judge humanity with our mere senses. The fact that we can't is the reason racism and fascism and sexism exists in the first place. You can't judge humanity by yourself and neither can I. Nobody can.  But we're supposed to be beyond that sort of thing. Open-thought and technology accelerate us as a race.

If we can only measure humanity by measuring consciousness, then that means, until a fetus has a developed brain with measurable brainwaves, it is only a mass of soulless meat.

However, cancer will never gain sentience; cancer will never learn; cancer will never go to school. Cancer is like a parasite, feeding off of the body and expanding until the body is dead.   I am completely for the use of the term 'fetus.' The excuse for the abortion is that the baby is not yet a baby, rather only a fetus. That is where they are wrong.

Do not conflate humanity (culture) with H. sapiens sapiens (biology).   \"What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.\"   You should be concerned with it. When living in a secular society, law is designed to help keep morals out of other peoples' affairs.   \"You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.\"   Self-awareness isn't a purely philosophical matter. Try looking into neurobiology. But if you can't be bothered, use this simple checklist:  #Does it have memory?  #Does it respond to stimuli?  #Does it have a central nervous system?  If you answered yes to all three, then it's probably self aware.   \"The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference. \"   You're resorting to an argument from nature fallacy. It doesn't matter whether or not the life comes artificially or through a naturally existing system, in both cases cells have the potential for life.   \"Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.\"   I ignore it because it has no rights. It isn't human. If you can't understand why a mass of cells smaller than a skin flake without a brain isn't human, then I suggest you stop arguing and read some college-level biology textbooks. You need a biology education.  But we're hovering around why you believe it is human, actually. This is probably a religious matter for you, not grounded in evidence, or logic.   \"And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.\"   It has no brains. It isn't a child yet, because it isn't born. Stop using language that is categorically wrong in order to try and tie together a poor argument.   \"When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).\"   I could argue that my religion treats as matter of faith that sperm has souls in all the cells, and that spilling sperm wastefully is murdering all those souls. I could them take up a moral platform with my church and crusade across the country trying to get masturbation banned along with pornography, and sex education.  The point to take from this is that these issues are rooted in dogma that cannot be argued away. Science already provides some clear-cut information that could be used to answer the question of whether a fetus or zygote is alive or should be properly construed as human in a legal context. Dogmatic people insist upon having beliefs however, with no evidence to support themselves beyond the emotional and intuitive appeal of their arguments.  You are the one here that is making a claim that is just assumed to be true, with no room for negotiation. You insist upon having beliefs instead of knowledge, and that is why I ridicule you.",

    "context": "I said there is good and evil and mostly gray, don't mince my words. Rape is one of the few things that is unconditionally evil. But even rape has neutrality in it. Let's say you rape someone as evil as Hitler, a murderer of innocent people. Is that evil? No. Fighting evil with evil is not evil, it is neutral.   There is only one truth, yes, but my point is that you don't know what that one truth is. Human perception is the only thing we can run on because it is the only way we can see things. You can't, I can't. Therefore, you cannot make assumptions of what the truth is by putting in place of it your opinions. My abortion belief is not opinionated in any way, and that's what separates me from you.  It's a radical thing to say abortion is wrong under any circumstance because the idea that it is takes away freedom from certain people. Is taking away freedom right when people don't all share you ideas? No. And yes, there is a gray area in pedophilia you ding-dong. Have you no imagination? Here's a scenario: You are an adult, and you make great friends with a teenager; one day, you fall in love with him/her and they feel mutually back despite you being much older then them. Is that love wrong? Just because there is an age gap? Not necessarily. Not all pedophiles are evil perverts just because you think they are.   What Hitler did WAS wrong, did I dispute that it wasn't? But in fact, it was gray in some areas. Why? Because he saved Germany. He did more evil then good, but in the end, he still was some gray despite being a lot of evil.  The 9/11 bombers were wrong to, but you have to realize, they were brought up in a third world country where they had nothing, where they starved to death whilst people like American's were getting hundreds of divorces every day. Yes, they killed people, but they suffered and died for their actions. Even in those acts, there was balance, despite being mostly evil.  It's meant to be contradictory. I don't believe in either radical, I trust in the balance between the two which I explained. Why are you arguing as if I believe in both of them at the same time? I'm not pro-choice, I'm just on this side of the debate. The fact is that a fetus isn't human at a certain stage and completely human after a certain point.  Just because we judge doesn't mean we know. I know facts when I speak of my abortion ideas, but I do not know facts when I make opinions of you.  You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.   I don't care what the dictionary says. Use your own definition for a human being. What separates humans from most animals is that we have a self-aware consciousness, a soul. Some animals also do, but not all, but that doesn't mean we aren't still defined by our personality, consciousness, and soul.  Just because something is alive doesn't mean it's alive like a human. A mushroom is alive. Is is it wrong to step on a mushroom? No, it has no consciousness. A severed chicken leg has living cells (for a time after being severed), is it wrong to cook and eat it? No. It has no consciousness. What about a  human  finger? Is it by itself human because it has living cells (for a time)? NO. To say it is human for that reason is illogical idiocy.  Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness. You think the mentally retarded have no consciousness? They do. They feel and think and have a soul. People in commas are sleeping. For a long time. They think and feel and have a soul.   Vegetable people are not human. They brains are dead. They feel nothing, think nothing, and have no soul. Only their organs are alive and their brains have no function except to keep their life processes going. They are vegetables. Are vegetables people? No. The person they were died with their brains. So yes,  vegetable people are soulless piece of meat .  I know that a soul inhabits a body when something has a consciousness. We have machines to tell this. What  you  do not have is a machine that can show that a soul inhabits a body before something has a consciousness.   Also, yes, I am God. I am a Pantheist. But that has nothing to do with this debate.  If humanists mention souls, then apparently I'm not a humanist. Duh.  No, I am not a butcher, but anyone can be a butcher if they want. The point is that masses of meat aren't human, dummy. Just because it's made of human cells doesn't make it human.  Just because something is unconscious doesn't mean it doesn't have a consciousness. So no, I am not being unscientific at all, nor grotesque and insane. You're insane for mincing my words together and taking everything I say in a manner that it does not mean.  Abortion to purify races isn't right if that's the intent. But the act of the abortion at a stage before consciousness isn't wrong, the intent is wrong.   Stem cell research is very beneficial for medical research. Though, killing a conscious fetus and selling it's body parts is immoral and disgusting.   That intent is wrong in some cases, but only the intent, not if the act of the abortion is before the fetus is conscious.   Once again, the intent is wrong, but the act of aborting before the fetus is conscious isn't.  I'm all over on what? Abortion is right when the fetus isn't a human. Once it's human, it's wrong. What's complicated about that? I know when a fetus is human, I can prove it. You can't prove that fetus is human before it has a consciousness.   Yes, I do, you do not need to provide a link.  No, I did not say that, I gave it as an example of one of the extreme points. I've already said 3 or 4 times that I do not agree with either extreme point, I'm just on this side out of coincidence, and now because you're zealously pro-life.  No, my comments are morally logical and make plenty of sense. What you thought my comments said by mincing the words together inside your mind is what makes no sense. What is wrong with you?",

It's still so very far from actually entering personhood.   I'm talking about human life, not personhood. Equivocating on terms is an attempt to ignore the obvious; were talking about human life.   I don't know where you get your definition   Oh I don't know, I just went to dictionary.com and got this definition and it doesn't discriminate on the basis of level of dependency like you do. What you call \"potential\" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not. Also, I couldn't find a definition for potential life, only an article referring to it as a \"a clever rhetorical trick\" And since the parents of this life are human It's safe to say it's human. That ought to be obvious to any casual observer. Here is the standard definition of life;   the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.     we don't actually need to ban abortion cos doing that doesn't actually help   Banning abortion wouldn't stop the killing of over 1500 humans a day? I hope your kidding because of course it would. That's why we ban things, to stop them. And yes, that would most certainly help all those innocent humans.   your argument that abortion equals murder is complete crap.   Well, let's see. Something that was, by the standard definition of life, alive is now not alive, by the standard definition of life. So if something was alive we refer to it as dead. And that death came by willful intent, not an accident. In a court of law that's referred to as premeditated homicide. But since you can discriminate on the basis of level of dependency or level of development I guess that makes it OK, right ? I don't think so.

At that moment, whether the baby has a pumping heart or not, it becomes a mother's natural and personal responsibility to do what is best for the baby. That could mean one of many options, such as raising the baby yourself, putting it up for adoption, or any number of alternatives. But I will tell you, as basic human decency should tell you, that anyone arguing that the termination of that baby is what's best for the baby is wrong in the most perverse way conceivable.   You chose to act irresponsibly. Now you must face the consequences, and just because you don't want to does NOT give you the right to terminate the existence of a potential human being.  Now, of course there are cases of rape and/or incest conceptions. In these cases, I do not feel that the mother should be forced to carry a child she does not deserve to have. She did nothing wrong, and should not be forced to carry the offspring of her rapist. But at the same time, I still believe that life begins at conceptions, and at that point it become a moral judgment for the mother to make. Do you believe in giving life to another human being, filling it with opportunity to make a name for himself or herself, or do you believe that you'd like to deliver children following consensual and natural intercourse between a man and a woman? At that point, the government should have nothing to do at all with the mother's say; she is no longer the irresponsible one, but rather the victim of a gruesome and despicable crime.",

    "context": "So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?    Yes.   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.",

Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.    You do not need to imply that I am so stupid as to not realize a fetus and mother are not the same species. I have already pointed out that some definitions of parasitism include a stipulation about species, and others do not. The distillation of the relationship, however, as I have explained I don't know how many times, is that one organism takes without returning and one organism gives involuntarily without receiving. This exactly describes the relationship between both a mother and a fetus and a parasite and its host.  For the sake of not being stuck on this semantic point forever, I will stop using the term 'parasitic relationship' and use the phrase 'a relationship in which the fetus siphons resources without contribution and the mother gives involuntarily and may very well suffer ill consequences of varying severity due to the presence of the fetus'.    Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about.   I am not familiar with the abortion issue in other countries and thus my arguments are concerning abortion in America only.   In America, the Supreme Court does not consider abortion to be murder. This is evidence by the fact that doctors who perform abortion in legal states are not arrested and charged with murder, and unless I am mistaken, the women who receive abortions, legal or not, are not arrested and charged with murder either.   What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries.    It doesn't matter to me whether or not abortion was first legalized because of a lie or that one of the involved parties was later arrested for anything. What matters to me is that abortion is a right women should have or continue to have, even if they became pregnant during consensual sex. My feelings on this are not based on any legal precedent.    You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.    It ruled the fetus is  alive . Not that it is equal to  a human life . Bacteria, plants, and chickens are  alive  but they are not  human lives . Do you understand the difference? If the Supreme Court had ruled that fetuses are not just alive but also human lives, they would have no choice but to rule abortion as murder.   Can your skin develop into a human being or develop heart or organ cells?   No, and neither can a fetus if you abort it.",

This is not a pro-life person. This is a person who even though they might not get an abortion themselves\u00e2\u0080\u00a6is willing to sit by quietly while others kill in the name of CHOICE.   THEY ARE PRO-ABORTS. I can just see someone at a Right to Life convention\u00e2\u0080\u00a6standing up and saying\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\" I am pro-life but believe that women should have the choice to kill.\" They would be laughed out of the room.  There is no difference between someone who is pro-abortion and someone who is pro-choice\u00e2\u0080\u00a6they want the same thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.legalized killing.   Cutting off a piece of skin\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.compared to stopping a beating heart of a human in the womb\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..you think is the same thing? Laughable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6won't even comment.  You probably no doubt think that killing a bug is the same as killing a human being\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.hey they are both alive right?  Yes babies are costly. How much did your parents foot the bill for your maintenance? At least your mother allowed you life\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and you are here debating and defending the rights of other mothers\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to kill, to take away the rights of others. What is it that Ronald Reagan said\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it was so true.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born.\u00e2\u0080?  Question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I know you are pro-abortion. Do you believe the a woman has the right to kill throughout the entire nine months? Oh I can't wait to see just how many rights you give women\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.to own their bodies.   Why is abortion bad you ask?   You said and I quote\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\"I think you'll have to look very hard to find someone who is actually pro abortion, I've definitely never met someone who openly admits to that. It's pro-choice.\"  What is wrong with owning the label? You tell me what is wrong with being called pro-abortion? Is there something wrong with abortion Ben?  If there is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6then why do you support it? If there isn't\u00e2\u0080\u00a6why isn't the label ok?   LOL",

    "context": "You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me how many people it takes to conceive a child. Can a woman conceive on her own? Can a man produce a child on his own? No. Both sexes are required to conceive a baby, they are both responsible for the act of conception.\u00e2\u0080?  It takes two, the woman can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conceive on her own and no man can produce a child on his own. But that has nothing to do with responsibility. Our government even though it recognizes the father if they are married\u00e2\u0080\u00a6does not take him into consideration, should she want to abort. He simply is not an issue. The government recognizes the risks of the woman and awards here the right to decide.     If they are both are responsible for the risks they take\u00e2\u0080\u00a6then why are the fathers rights stripped?  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnswer this question please. Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.\u00e2\u0080?  Yes he does. Yes he does. Yes he does. BUT, he also knows he can walk away if he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be involved. Example\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..  Two kids having sex on the beach during spring break. They want to have sex obviously for pleasure. They might not even know their names or where they are from. Now who takes the big risk should they get pregnant? The guy or the gal. Who can fade into the sunset, never to be seen or heard from again? THE MAN She takes the big risk. What risk did the kid take? NONE. This Cassie Anthony trial\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..she says she has no idea who the father of Caylee was. She was known for sleeping around and they did DNA samples on many of her acquaintances. Nothing turned up. They even did DNA on her father and brother. Who got pregnant, who had the baby? She did\u00e2\u0080\u00a6because whether reckless sex happened or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the risk she took didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pan out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.she got pregnant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and where is the dad???????  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on all grounds. Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by law then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?\u00e2\u0080?  Well in my opinion he should be considered on all grounds. In this case I believe she should have the baby and that because she did not want it, it would go to him.   You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?\u00e2\u0080?   Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so ridiculous it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings \u00e2\u0080\u009c  You also said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps you re-read that section because here is what I said   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.  I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.\u00e2\u0080?  And you want to compare your use of the noun Pig\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to the descriptions I have used? Do you know the difference between a noun and an adjective? You gotta come up with something better than this. LOL   A pig is a filthy animal that lives in a sty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6LMAO   How old are you really, are you even an adult? What I stated was the truth in the nicest terms possible.   And why are you bringing religion into this. All these humanists bringing religion into debates\u00e2\u0080\u00a6when I have not. Is it because of my name? Again ignorance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6go research what a churchmouse is. Do you think that Christians because of the love commandment should just take it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6roll over and play dead? Why do you judge me by perfect standards and not yourself. You have a filthy mouth and it demeans your posts\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and makes you look like you have no class. You use the F bomb like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conjunction. Your views on abortion and the reasons for it mirror Hitler and Sangers and I could add a few more for that matter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..but will leave it with these two. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you do some heavy research on this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not just cut and pasting something you quickly found on google? Your position is heartless, cold, and you like I said are ignorant of the facts. Your pro-abort position makes for champion killing, not life.  I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou said yourself that you believe for whatever reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.  You said, I know and your point is?\u00e2\u0080?  And this is not championing abortion? LMAO And you want people to believe your pro-life? LMAO  I said this, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man Then you replied with this. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They both decide to have sex, they both know the risks, they both procreate. They are both responsible.\u00e2\u0080?  Why? is biology sexist? The truth is the truth it seeks no sides. We have hashed this over and over and you will never get it I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid. The man does not have to assume squat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6unless he is married and the courts order him to pay. Did the kid on the beach have to do anything? How many one night stands you think happen when the male just takes off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6knowing or not knowing if he impregnanted the woman?  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.'  Not true, go educate yourself, not going to do it for you. Bugger? Boy have not heard that one since Kindergarten.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.\u00e2\u0080?  Only because she says YES. He goes on her invite. If they are running around the bases\u00e2\u0080\u00a6have not scored a grand slam\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and she says no\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come in. If he does against her wishes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rape. Instigating has nothing to do with this. But whose body is changed by the sex act? Not his..Hers. She knows that what he might leave behind will affect her for at least nine months. He knows that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect him in the least\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..UNLESS HE IS MARRIED.     \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers do have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.\u00e2\u0080?  It does take a man and a woman to procreate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6which is why I also am against same sex unions, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not natural\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another debate. They both have sex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.blah blah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..and as I said unless he is married he can take off and never be seen again. SO WHO TAKES THE BIG RISK?  Sure some married couples are on the same page\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.but we will never know how many married women go behind their spouses backs to kill, because they know their husband would not approve. There is no way of knowing that statistic.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.  Not true. I state the facts and back them up with scientific evidence. You champion killing so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see the evidence. You want the killing option open which in my opinion is cold.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.\u00e2\u0080?  Why on earth would you of all people be sorry? Mind boggling to say the least. I am not a hypocrite, I simply made a mistake lived in hell and want to share my story. My kind of story is the one PP does not want out there, because they want abortion pictures in the best way.     Tell me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Have you ever in your entire life made a mistake? Did you ever think you knew the truth about something and then found that you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that way all along? Are human beings allowed to make and learn by their errors? What?...we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change our minds about issues, feelings? Must be nice to be perfect. Well my position on abortion changed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I am allowed to change my mind\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..are you?   When you make a huge mistake\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.if you have children don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to protect them, teach them what might hurt them? What you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.is that I do not have the right to change my mind, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a right to warn people about what could happen especially mentally with abortion? You are the one who is judgemental and arrogant\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. but then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perfect remember?   \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.\u00e2\u0080?  Oh my goodness don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I was not a child when I had it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I should have known better\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and I took the risk because I knew what would happen. But like most others in the heat of passion I guess I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care and did it anyway. No one thrusted anything on me, and guess what, I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a wonderful person MOST of the time, not perfect like you but I am ok. I have raised two wonderful, happy and successful children, am a grandmother to two little girls, have been married over thirty years to the SAME MAN\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and have a blessed life. Christ forgave me when I became His. And I promised Him that abortion would be my witness\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to share what HE did for me in my hour of need. I am the luckiest person in the world. The baby I aborted was my husbands. A pregnancy at that time would have been hard. We were on the same page\u00e2\u0080\u00a6until later\u00e2\u0080\u00a6when I started suffering, he could not understand my feelings. He was supportive but of course our faiths in God are different, because when I became Christs, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Worldviews change\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and mine did drastically. We have adjusted\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and he now tolerates my feelings, actions. I do not force my beliefs on him. I pray someday we will be on the same page.     You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?\u00e2\u0080?  Distraught about what? Tell me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.how can you on one hand think abortion is horrible, not a fairy lala trip\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.then go against what your morals tell you is wrong? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it. Abortion if you have ever seen one is horrible. Have you ever seen one? Anyone who does not see one and think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horrendous\u00e2\u0080\u00a6is cold, compassionless and EMPTY.   Here watch this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, think about the reasons why you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Search your heart\u00e2\u0080\u00a6about why you would support something so barbaric. And if you have children\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.put them in the place of the tiny one who is getting slaughtered.      http://www.catholic.org/video/?v=13       I am not Catholic but they always have good stuff on their sites about abortion.     \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.\u00e2\u0080?  What is upsetting about it? And who says the kids are young? I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell a child about abortion for all the obvious reasons. I would at least wait until the child was the age when a lot of kids are having sex. I told my kids when they were teenagers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not selfish\u00e2\u0080\u00a6its real life and it happens. Kids see a lot of gruesome stuff on television. What makes abortion different you tell me? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most performed surgery in the world.     I said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.\u00e2\u0080?  You are pro-abortion period, end of story. You want to deceive yourself into thinking you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not but you are. You condone what that video I wanted you to watch\u00e2\u0080\u00a6shows. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you think should be legal. You do not stand up for all life.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.\u00e2\u0080?  Well there were people back then who stood by and did nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and looked the other way. In a way it was humanity at its worst that let all those gassed down. Everyone participated\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6good should have overcome evil, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. People act out of fear\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I am sure there were people who did not like what Hitler was doing BUT DIDN\u00e2\u0080\u0099T DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I am talking about the people in his own country\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.the people who could have physically taken himout\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.the guards, etc.   Abortion is like that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.people sit by and do nothing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.they think anything they do\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the laws, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help the victim. But if every pastor on every pulpit preached the evils of abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.if every parent with compassion in his heart would stand up for what is right and good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.abortion would once again be considered murder. If we stood up as a nation about the evils of abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.wow\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.how many lives would be changed, hearts mended. But we are a secular country that has turned its face from God\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and it shows by our morals and our morals influence our laws. I work with people who are atheists\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.so it is possible for people with no faith at all to stand up and make a difference. Its knowing what is right and wrong, what is good and evil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..standing up for it, no matter what.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgain what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.\u00e2\u0080?  Again talking about standing up for what is right, doing the right thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..even if you are swimming up stream. I know the odds are against abortion being overturned are slim to none\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but I keep working and praying I am wrong. Society is sinking into a moral less abyss.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.\u00e2\u0080?  You condone murder\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I never called you a racist.     You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?\u00e2\u0080?  I never use violent adjectives on you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.you used a noun to describe me. And swearing is classless\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  .  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't say pain is the only reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it was true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.\u00e2\u0080?  Well you hold the cards to your future eternity. No one else is responsible but you. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you will have all eternity to think about it. How do you know EVERYONE has been condemned? And how do you know that you will be recognizable in hell to your family and friends? If you went to hell with them\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..being with family etc\u00e2\u0080\u00a6would be just a tad bit good\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you would have support, be near the ones you love. And if you have support, then it is not hell. LOL What happens if you get there and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find anyone? Well you would have all eternity thrashing about to find them I suppose.   I know many people in my family who will not go\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that is their choice. I bothers me, and I cry about it sometimes when I am praying. But I love Christ more than any other person in the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and I have faith in Him\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.more than I have faith in anyone that has ever been in my life. I believe that I will not know if any family does not make it. Heaven is perfect\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and it would be hell if you knew someone was not there that you loved.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning again if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?\u00e2\u0080?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny all the nonreligious, materialists, humanists, atheists, agnostics always bring up religion, must be they think about it a lot. LOL I do not feel I called you names. I described and compared your worldview to people you obviously you have a problem with. I am certainly not trying to get revenge, come on. I am simply showing you why your worldview is not compassionate or all that good. I am bold, and I do state the facts in ways people feel offended. But I think down inside they are offended because what I say exposes them, gets them thinking about what they think is ok. And you think abortion is ok. And\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.you are judging me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I point out what you say that are untruths but I am not judging your heart\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, scripture does not allow me to do that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not unless you claim to be a Christian. That is why I bring no scriptures up with you because you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know better. God will judge you. I can however judge actions (not hearts) of Christians as they can judge mine and many have done that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I thank them for it because many times more than I would like to admit, I needed judgement. Why do you quote a book you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in? LOL  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.\u00e2\u0080?  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in it, yet you use it to make a point. LOL     You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.\u00e2\u0080?  You are a pro-abort and you champion abortion period\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.live with it accept the label take it as your own.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy because you post things from Wikipedia? Wow I wish I had that knowledge. Don't tell me I need to 'get educated' I think it's clear to see who has more accurate spelling and grammar. The only things I've posted are links and small quotes. Everything else is my words. You ask for evidence you get it.\u00e2\u0080?  LOL Boy you are really diggin deep now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. I post rarely from Wikipedia\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and on this forum have posted from very reliable sources. I am not however handing my posts in to be graded\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.so I could care less about absolute perfect spelling and punctuation. I work\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I live a full life and when I get on here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I slam it out the fastest way I can. If I had to hand in an article or paper \u00e2\u0080\u00a6.it would be correct.     You have provided however little evidence, more lies. Just like the lie about the earliest born preemie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.I showed you your error. I work in this field and I know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c\u00e2\u0080?  This is your worldview\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and explains what I said all along\u00e2\u0080\u00a6why you are pro-abortion. The lack of love for your fellow man shows your true heart. I feel sorry for you actually.     You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?\u00e2\u0080?  Who is setting abortion clinics on fire? If you compare the acts of violence against how many abortion clinics there are in the world\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6its nothing. Pro-lifers are basically kind and compassionate people who respect the law\u00e2\u0080\u00a6just try to change it. Am I preaching? What is the difference between you putting opinion and facts out and what I am doing? Do you ever look in a mirror?   You simply act like a juvenile. You have no class... You do not even know what you are saying.   LOL  You said two things in your post\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you are against abortion at the end of the second trimester which would be 24 weeks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and here you say 12 weeks it feels pain. LOL   Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let this one go\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6your hilarious. I mean that in the nicest comedic way possible. LOL     This is what you said earlier\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.\u00e2\u0080?  So is it 12 weeks when you say the fetus can feel pain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.or 24 weeks when obviously it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. LOL  You do not even know your own position. That is why you look silly and have to swear.   Do you even know when the fetus can feel pain? LOL Naw\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.",

Because the woman allowed the man to fertilize her egg. Therefore, when a woman's get pregnant, it is the woman's fault only. Except when the situation comes to rape but this is not rape.

But isn't that just like human nature, everything is just fine until something conflicts with what we want and stands between us and what we desire. Then laws get broke, peace treaties ignored, property taken and people killed. But the most heinous crime is when we make laws to exonerate ourselves. When we call evil, good. We may be guiltless before the law but that doesn't mean we are not without real quilt. But praise be to God that He has provided a solution to the two greatest problems man faces, guilt and death.

    "context": "While abortion may not be considered as murder or manslaughter, one thing is for sure. By going ahead with an abortion, you are denying someone, or atleast something life. Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.   Had the fetus not been terminated, it could've had so much potential. It would grow up to be a child. It would get to listen to music, smell the first day of spring and catch the first glimpse of snow. Everything we take for granted in life and life itself, is taken from the fetus.   Many argue that an unborn child does not have consciousness and therefore, it is morally acceptable to undergo an abortion. In the same sense, is it alright to inject lethal toxin into a child that has been sedated for his whole life? Pro-choice people are therefore saying that we can deny life to something that has never experienced consciousness. This argument is irrational and morally incorrect.  What's more worrying is that the mother of a fetus makes this decision. The very provider of life and sustenance refuses to let her unborn child live. It is not her choice to make. It is no one's choice to make. No one should have the authority to deny an unborn child life. Imagine the world without you, because your mother had an abortion. You would never live all of your experiences. You would never have emotions. You would've never existed. Such is the travesty of abortion. Over a million lives, of which collectively would add up to over 70 million years, would never be lived.  Rape, sadly does happen. But legalizing abortion does not solve the problem. If we want to reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies as a result of rape, then we need to tackle the issue of rape itself. Harsher penalities, stricter monitoring policies, promoting rape whistles, reducing poverty and a nationwide sex offender registry are all possible solutions for this. Reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies from rape down to zero is next to impossible, but we can get this number a lot lower.   Unwanted adult and teenage pregnancies can be solved by removing the social stigma associated with contraceptives. Pharmacies and the government should advocate the use of condoms or birth control pills as a way to enjoy sex without any unwanted consequences.  Abortion means denying the opportunity of life to what would've been a someone. We cannot continue with this madness.",

So let me modify what I said; the reasons commonly given for abortions are in adequate.   In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else.   So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas.

A fetus makes its home inside the mother's body and leeches energy and nutrients from her, which is very taxing on her body. The fetus does not contribute anything in return. This is, without a doubt, the definition of a parasitic relationship. I don't know how you can interpret this relationship as the 'opposite' of what I stated as that would entail the mother leeching from the fetus without contributing anything in return.  The bodily autonomy of the woman  is  infringed upon  if  she doesn't want the fetus to continue using her as a host and she is forbidden from seeking an abortion.  Back to the patient: I admit that I am unfamiliar with legal complications like that. However, it still seems that everyone involved has a way of disentangling themselves from a situation of caring for a paralyzed person, if they wish to do so. The person with power of attorney can recuse, as you said, and doctors voluntarily take care of patients because it is their job. If they didn't like it, they could quit or transfer. No matter what kind of bizarre hypothetical one can pose with a paralyzed person, it is still not an issue of the caretakers' rights to bodily autonomy being challenged.  If you have a newborn baby and a mother who does not want to take care of that newborn baby, then the solution is simple; she gives up her rights to the baby and someone else takes care of it. It still needs her permission to be able to use her body for survival, but in this case, if she chooses not to grant it, it can survive in other ways. This is not the case with an inviable fetus.",

Thus you cannot cite law to support an argument that is based on ethical considerations.  So yes if it pleases you let us assume I am Irish..or from a country that makes elective abortion illegal.   If the law changes, it still doesn't change that birth is a distinct and unambiguous process separating the foetus from the newborn (also, I am aware of cesarean section, I still consider this birthing).  In other words, law is simply an auxiliary, convenient bit.   So Apples mate with other Apples then?....please your association is strained to say the least.   Apples provide seeds which are post-pollination. Besides that in biology there is asexual reproduction, which precludes the necessity for mating.   You cite various sources describing metabolic processes in fruit.  You are being disingenious..   No, I am acknowledging that apples are composed of living cells. Living cells take in and excrete waste.   We both know that Apples are not classified as living organisms...as they have the same genome in their cells that contain DNA as the tree or bush they are attached to...they are fruits...not organisms.   Plant cells are alive, by the standard definition. In theory you should be able to asexually propagate apple cells, too, and grow new trees. I have never done this, however, but as I understand it you convert the plant cell into a protoplast and place it in a regulated growth medium, like agar. The main difficulty I believe would be reversing the cellular differentiation so that the cell may show pluripotence.   Eat a fruit and you kill nothing.   Except millions of innocent plant cells. Who will defend them? They are defenseless! Oh the humanity of it all!   I shall cite a reference for you...   Apples are not fruit according to the purely strict definition you provided, they are accessory fruits.   You seem to be a bit confused about the differences between fruit and living multi cellular organisms with their own unique genome and conformity with the biological necessities to be declared living multicellular organisms.   You keep throwing around that word \"unique\" as if it is a prerequisite to life that it have a unique genome. Bananas are asexually propagated, they bear no seeds, so they share the same genome for all members of a cultivar.",

Life is the most sacred, fundamental right of a human being. While an unborn may not be considered a human being, the fetus would've been a human being. Therefore, you reuse to give life to something that would've been a person.    It's a poetic argument but it's deeply irrational because the sentiment you employed isn't used for anything else in the world. Specifically I'm referring to the fact that the choices we make often deny others life in some obscure way. For example, assuming you live in the United States, by voting in leaders who continue to engage in war, you are enabling people in a far away country the right to life. But it gets worse, but refusing to lobby or protest for military action in Somalia you are allowing an area of the world to exist which destroys lives every second. How about poverty? How many people in the favelas in Brasil are being butchered as we speak and yet we're doing nothing?  Let's take the argument to its logical extremes. If you've ever used birth control, or engaged in any form of sexual act without procreation as the aim, you are destroying millions of cells that could have been a person. Suppose you only ever engaged in reproductive sex, what about spontaneous abortions that happen all the time and are not even noticed? How about our recent advances in biology, specifically genetic engineering and cloning. How much DNA have you destroyed that could have been cloned into another person?  The only point I'm trying to make is that although your argument is very kind in its intentions and poetic, it's too absolute to apply to life in this world. We have to recognise that lives can have priority. Sure a fetus could be a person, but the mother is already a person and her wants and needs outweigh a possible person. Sure, the starving and innocent in South America deserve support, but first we need to get our country better off so that we can afford the massive donations to infrastructure.",

You talk about bodily sovereignty....I would assume you mean the right for a woman to abort at any time during the pregnancy since she certainly keeps her own body throughout the term. This means any woman because she has sole ownership of her body can decide what to do with it, even kill in the ninth month. Am I right? Is that what you are saying?  Pregnancy is not dangerous to 99% of those doing it. Less than 1% of ALL WOMEN getting abortions do it because of health issues. And in most case both mother and baby can be saved. So most woman abort because of social issues.   Having a baby is a natural thing to do. Many women do not even go to doctors to be watched and have no problems at all. So don't make the statement that it carries risks above and beyond what pregnancy implies. How many woman die a year in childbirth compared to those who have successful pregnancies? Not many.  You are saying two things in your statement. She owns her body, but she doesn't. Can she abort in the 9th month? NO..........but she should have the right to abort. Abortion kills. If that is what she wants to do, to kill it even in the ninth month, what right do you have then based on what you have said here.....to deny her the right?",

It has no characteristics different than what the mother and the father have or have at least passed onto it. Something that is not an individual is not entitled to those rights.

This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Life_unworthy_of_life    Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.  In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book   From Darwin to Hitler  by Dr. Richard Weikart  Now to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?  At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs.

    "context": "What? Ending a life isn't cruel? So i guess we should let murders and rapes takes place too because those are not cruel acts. Oh and i posted some information on the methods of abortion for you. These are the cruel methods stated again:  METHODS OF TERMNATION OF PREGNANCY  There are three abortion classifications\u00e2\u0080\u0094surgical abortion, medical abortion, and chemical abortion. They are defined as follows:  Surgical abortion: These are abortions that involve an invasive procedure. Major types of surgical abortions include:   Suction aspiration: This is the procedure most often used in the first trimester of pregnancy (the first three months). The abortionist inserts a suction tube (similar to a vacuum hose with an extremely sharp end) into the mother's womb. The suction and cutting edge dismember the baby while the hose sucks the body parts into a collection bottle.   Dilation and curettage (D&C;): In this procedure, the abortionist uses a loop shaped knife to cut the baby into pieces and scrape the uterine wall. The baby's body parts are then removed and checked to make sure that no pieces were left in the mother's womb.   Dilation and extraction (also known as D&X;or partial-birth abortion): Used to kill babies well into the third trimester (as late as 32 weeks old), the abortionist reaches into the mother's womb, grabs the baby's feet with a forceps and pulls the baby out of the mother, except for the head. The abortionist then jams a pair of scissors into the back of the baby's head and spreads the scissors apart to make a hole in the baby's skull. The abortionist removes the scissors and sticks a suction tube into the skull to suck the baby's brain out. The forceps are then used to crush the baby's head and the abortionist pulls the baby's body out the rest of the way.   Dilation and evacuation (D&E;): This form of abortion is used to kill babies in the second trimester (24+ weeks). The abortionist uses a forceps to grab parts of the baby (arms and legs) and then tears the baby apart. The baby's head must be crushed in order to remove it because the skull bone has hardened by this stage in the baby's growth.   Hysterotomy: Performed in the third trimester, this is basically an abortive Cesarean section (C-section). The abortionist makes in an incision in the mother's abdomen and removes the baby. The baby is then either placed to the side to die or is killed by the abortionist or nurse.   Medical abortions: These are abortions that involve the administration of drug specifically intended to abort the child. Common drugs used for medical abortions include:  Mifepristone (RU-486): Mifepristone blocks the hormone that helps develop the lining of the uterus during pregnancy (progesterone). This lining is the source of nutrition and protection for the developing baby. The tiny boy or girl is starved to death and then a second drug, misoprostol, causes contractions so that the dead baby is expelled from the womb.   Methotrexate: this highly toxic chemical directly attacks and breaks down the baby's fast-growing cells. It also attacks the life-support systems the baby needs to survive. When the systems fail, the baby dies. Misoprostol is then used to cause contractions and push the dead baby out of the womb.   Salt poisoning: This technique is used in the second and third trimester. The abortionist sticks a long needle into the mother's womb. The needle contains salt which is then injected into the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby. The baby breathes in, swallows the salt and dies from salt poisoning, dehydration, brain hemorrhage and convulsions. Taking nearly an hour to die, the baby's skin is completely burned, turns red and deteriorates. The baby is in pain the entire time. The mother goes into labor 24 - 48 hours later and delivers a dead baby.   Prostaglandins: Used during the second and third trimester, prostaglandin abortions involve the injection of naturally produced hormones into the amniotic sac, causing violent premature labor. During these convulsions the baby is often crushed to death or is born too early to have any chance of surviving.   Chemical abortions: These are abortions caused by drugs that, at least some of the time, prevent the implantation of the already-created baby in the uterine lining. Some of the more popular methods of birth control that can be responsible for the deaths of newly-created children are:   The Ortho-Evra\u00c2\u00ae birth control patch works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the lining of the uterus thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (Physicians' Desk Reference. 60 ed. Montvale, NJ: Thompson PDR; 2006. 2402).   The NuvaRing\u00c2\u00ae vaginal ring works by suppressing gonadotropins, which may inhibit ovulation, change the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching the uterus and change the endometrium thereby preventing the implantation of the newly-formed human (PDR. 2357).  Depo-Provera\u00c2\u00ae Contraceptive Injection, when administered at the recommended dose to women every 3 months, inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins which, in turn, prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and results in endometrium thinning. These actions produce its contraceptive effect (PDR 2620).   Plan B\u00c2\u00ae is believed to act as an emergency contraceptive principally by preventing ovulation or fertilization, by altering the tubal transport of sperm and/or ova. In addition, it may inhibit implantation by altering the endometrium (PDR 1068",

What facts do you know just curious.   \"You're right, you don't need anyone to tell you right from wrong, but neither do I, because I don't have opinions about this, I know facts about this. That's what I base my morality on.\"   The fact is that which is growing in the womb is a human being. The abortionist goal is to kill that which is growing. That is a biological fact.   So if you base your morality on facts.....why are you pro-abortion? That speaks volumes about how you come up with what is moral and what is not. You yourself think you are god.......so in your mind, sex with children could be a good thing, cheating, lying and stealing could also be moral.....even child abuse.  I find it sad that in your post you defend evil. Where is the balance in that?  \"Yes, humanity is measured by consciousness.\"  For people who live godless lives it might. For people who do not consider all human life sacred....for those who are moral relativists it might. I find it sad that you eliminate groups of people who are living but unconscious. That they lose the right to live while in this state. People who are in comas, under for surgeries...even sleeping is a form of being unconscious. So because a child is in the womb...does not mean they are not aware of what is going on especially physically. When I was pregnant I used to push in on my baby....and prode it until it moved....aware of my touch.   Your view on life is sad. Vegetable people are nothing? You are so so cold. I feel sad for you really, that your worldview IMO of course is so empty. That you would compare a living person to meat. What a cold way of putting it.",

The male who has sex with her and impregnates takes half the responsibility for pregnancy. It's not solely a woman.   Why do you feel that rape and incest warrent abortion   Because if a child is going to make her life more awful than what she's already experienced she has the choice to not go through that. I'm not saying you  should  abort in these circumstances but I understand entirely why people do.   And are you saying that because a child has a deformity that it deserves to die?    You are possibly the biggest word mincer ever. I personally wouldn't abort a child on these grounds and I'm not saying people  should . But yet again I understand and sympathize with someone who does.   .Hitler had the same idea did you know that?   Stop calling and comparing me to Hitler. It's so rude.   You are making excuses for the killing.   I'm not making excuses. I'm saying I understand why woman would abort in these situations. Stop acting like I advocate death and I'm murdering people.   How about the woman who does not want to get stretch marks   I think that's probably a very selfish reason however I don't know the woman's background maybe she has serious depression and her self esteem is low. Hence I said \"life would be impacted seriously (not superficially)\" Oh and in response to your question about I meant, I mean personally if someone were to abort because it was the wrong sex or something along those lines I'd probably think it was a bit selfish. But I wouldn't out right deny the woman the right to do so. And don't call me a hypocrite, because I still believe the woman has the right to abort under those circumstances.   What right do you have to tell a woman why she cant abort at any time   This is coming from the person who believes a woman has no right to abort at all? A woman can abort for whatever reason she likes it has nothing to with me I've never led you to believe that I think only some woman can abort. And just to clarify I've already posted the scientific studies and facts on when a baby feels pain and it's brain is active, and why that is my defining limit on abortion gestation with some exception.

A human potential life before a certain stage in its development shouldn't be afforded any rights whatsoever.  .   What you call \"potential\" it calls life. In fact it makes no such distinction. Something is either alive or not.   You're still dishing out BS and completely ignoring my points. Look up \"potential\" separately, then marry the 2 definitions together and then you should read this: I agree that it's life, I'm only making a distinction that it's potential. This is the case because even though it may have all the internal systems of a human life, they're in no condition to function until a certain stage is reached in its development. That's why it's a potential life. If you're incapable of putting the meanings of 2 separate words together, we should stop any further discussions.  .

    "context": "So the laws say that a woman should not use her body for the purpose of prositution. So would you say that the laws are infringing upon the body of the woman?   Check up the details of science. A human embryo or fetus is an organism of one species (Homo sapiens) living in the uterine cavity of an organism of the same species (Homo sapiens) and deriving its nourishment from the mother (is metabolically dependent on the mother). This homospecific relationship is an obligatory dependent relationship, but not a parasitic relationship. A parasite is an invading organism -- coming to parasitize the host from an outside source. A human embryo or fetus is formed from a fertilized egg -- the egg coming from an inside source, being formed in the ovary of the mother from where it moves into the oviduct where it may be fertilized to form the zygote -- the first cell of the new human being. When a parasite invades a host, the host will usually respond by forming antibodies in response to the somatic antigens (molecules comprising the body of the parasite) or metabolic antigens (molecules secreted or excreted by the parasite) of the parasite. Parasitism usually involves an immunological response on the part of the host.   When the human embryo or fetus attaches to and invades the lining tissue of the mother's uterus, the lining tissue responds by surrounding the human embryo and does not cut it off from the mother, but rather establishes a means of close contact (the placenta) between the mother and the new human being.  New evidence, presented by Beer and Billingham in their article, \"The Embryo as a Transplant\" (Scientific American, April, 1974), indicates that the mother does react to the presence of the embryo by producing humoral antibodies, but they suggest that the trophoblast -- the jacket of cells surrounding the embryo -- blocks the action of these antibodies and therefore the embryo or fetus is not rejected. This reaction is unique to the embryo-mother relationship.  Abortion was and is considered murder in some countries and states so what are you talking about. What about in Wade vs. Roe when Jane Roe was charged by the DA for attempted murder because she wanted to commit an abortion. She claimed she was raped but the truth is she was never. She had consensual sex. That is the root towards the leglaization of abortion before it was and is still known as murder in some countries. You say a fetus is not legally considered a human life but perhaps you should read up on the case Webster vs. Reproducitve Health Servies in which the U.S Supreme Court in their ruling concluded that life begins at conception which means that the fetus is legally considered a human life.

Now you may think, \"Taking a hike in no man's land is also a decision that includes risk\" and you'd be right. But I believe this is where the debate breaks down to individual opinion. I am of the opinion that when a person becomes a parent (by deliberate decision or otherwise) they are responsible for the safety of that new human. Even to the extent of risking their own lives.

If there are, then there are two possibilites:  1. Humans obtain their inalienable rights purely by being a human being.

We start bartering and haggling. When does a human get rights, what rights, which humans should get them etc etc. But if we conclude with this option, then there is no real reason to limit ourselves to the unborn - Nazi Germany is a very modern example of a nation haggling with these inalienable rights on born human beings.  So first of all, we need to see what implications rise from the views and ideas to which we have attached ourselves to.  Now that you've thought about these implications, lets look at abortion from an honest perspective - it's the termination of the life of a developing human being for the sake of perserving the convenience and the satisfaction of another person. This is against all reason. Convenience does not justify the termination of another human's life - murder.  The parents are generally always responsible for the creation of the fetus, so they should have the moral obligation to support the life of that fetus. If they do not want the child, they can give him/her up for adoption - adoption is not some myth. We must also strive for the creation of institutions that would take care of unwanted children in a loving, productive environment. Murder is not an acceptable alternative for a civilized nation.  Given the fact that pregnancy lasts 9 months, one needs to ask themselves - Is murder justified by temporary inconvenience?  For the sake of comparison, think of the USA, 1800 - the question of slavery. Some of you may object, but the general rethoric at the time was completely the same - Blacks are not fully human, thus they have no rights ; We should not force our opinions on other people, lets respect our freedom to choose ; We are not ready for such an extensive protection of human rights, we need to go step by step etc etc.   Nowaydays we laugh and ridicule such arguments as we see it self-evidently that slavery is immoral and I'm convinced that 100 years from now, we'll be seeing abortion in the same light.

He does not even have to know, even if he is the father. If he was recognized as a player...the law would not be what it is today. Nothing forces her to put him on the birth certificate either. That is the law.  The fact is, the baby is hers at conception\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.she took the risk.  The sperm leaves his body...and enters her. His part is done. The sperm was a gift, he certainly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask for it back can he? LOL She holds the cards and has him by the you know what...that is if he wants the baby, because whether he wants it or not.......it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NOT AN ISSUE.    Of course I am a Christian and don't believe it should be this way, but that is the law today.     I believe personally that the man should be considered....that she should not be allowed to make a decision like that of abortion. Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs.     You said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair........why? You are trying to make yourself feel better look better. You are pro-choice and believe the option should be there remember. Consulting and being an equal member who makes decisions is another thing.  You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore. The man is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREGNANCY he allowed himself to get a woman pregnant. Your opinion is sexist is so many levels.\u00e2\u0080?  Am I calling names? Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call me a pig? Better reread that section. Am I insulting you because you are pro-abortion? Well gee I am sorry, the truth hurts. You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   Now if the way I described it sounds crass\u00e2\u0080\u00a6sorry, but I was not going into a lengthy description of how babies are made. Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the truth of how it happened.     As I said AGAIN\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.the man is an onlooker so says the law\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.that is if he is not married to the girl who is allowing him in. Is that better way to put it?     You are absolutely unbelievable. You want to blame\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and blame you do, for what is a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issue, so says the law. What do you not get? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he have a decision in the pregnancy? NO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS NO. HE IS NOT AN ISSUE and HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE.     As for condemning anyone for an abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6this discussion is not about that. I work with women who have had abortions\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.because I know what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like, I had one. I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through. The work I do is in this field, I see the pain, especially afterwards. And guess what\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..the pain is just not experienced by the woman, but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children. The woman calls the shots as I did when I had mine some thirty years ago. I would give anything to be able to take that day back\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill. Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ovens\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 pro-life? How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?  And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?  Of course you will retaliate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you condone abortion which is violence.     You ranted on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she should have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.\u00e2\u0080?  I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull? If someone drives someone to a robbery\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and they are caught\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.does the police just say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.ok you had nothing to do with it goodbye? I mean come on. If you refused to take her to the abortion, she might not get it. If the doctor didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, the nurse refuse to do it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6the baby might have a chance.   You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.\u00e2\u0080?

Bolonga\u00e2\u0080\u00a6many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.not just because of pain. Insult? Retaliation, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about, you said so yourself didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Then you judge me when you think I retaliate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.why are you judging me from different standards than you live by\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? LOL Oh yes because I am a Christian, right. Am I supposed to just sing kum ba yah around a campfire and shutup, not stand up for the things THAT ARE UNCHRISTIAN? No case for abortion can be made scripturally. Christ would want me to stand up the his little children, he would want me to share my testimony and how my sin, devastated my life until I came to Him. So you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like how I put things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.  I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth. You might be the greatest person in the world, but you are pro-abortion and do nothing to stand up against this injustice. you are not for and against....you are for......because you think it should be legal.     You said,\u00e2\u0080\u009c Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.\u00e2\u0080?

BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION. She calls the shots.  Now if they were not married, she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold him financially accountable for anything. The baby is hers, unless she puts his name on the birth certificate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and in that case he might for forced to pay.   You said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that is the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you. Which is where I get my opinion on when I think abortion is okay.\u00e2\u0080?  Well you are wrong again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ James_Elgin_Gill    128 days early\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or 21 weeks 5 days early  Then there was Amillia Taylor who is also often cited as the most-premature baby. She was born on 24 October 2006 in Miami, Florida, at 21 weeks and 6 days gestation. At birth she was 9 inches (23 cm) long and weighed 10 ounces (283 grams). She suffered digestive and respiratory problems, together with a brain hemorrhage. She was discharged from the Baptist Children's Hospital on 20 February 2007.  There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.     I know the information out there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Pain is not an issue\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.personhood is and you do not give the fetus any personhood at all.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had no worth for the womb why would I have a child?\"  You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????  Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?",

    "context": "How can the body of a woman be infringed upon when a woman knows the result of sexual intercourse is a fetus?   When she is prevented from dealing with her body as she sees fit, her rights to her own body are being infringed upon. This is self-evident and if you disagree you are going to have to explain yourself.    You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus. For a parasitic relationship, those elements of science have to exist.   There is no such thing as a 'human kingdom'. Humans are as much a part of the animal kingdom as cats, chimps, and mice.   Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return. The claim that pregnancy causes no injury to the woman leads me to believe you have never even spoken to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy is  extremely  taxing on the mother's body, even in environments where she has no shortage of food and does not need to be active.

This is technically injury to the woman, even though in some cases it may be minor, and is completely natural. If a woman were to be forced to endure a pregnancy based on what someone else think she should do with her body, I am sure the mental toll would also be enormous.    But a mother should not recuse herself from the birth of her fetus when the fetus contains her DNA and is equivalent to murder. Murder is the intentional taking of a human life which in this case refers to abortion itself as well.   You are studying law and you are trying to say abortion is legally murder? A fetus is not legally considered a human life and so it cannot fit the definition of murder as you are using it.   The fetus having possession of the mother's DNA has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is murder. Your skin cells have your DNA but you are not committing murder when you scratch yourself. This point is also of subjective importance; don't assume that what matters to you is what matters to everyone.  Even if I did consider a fetus to be a human life, I still maintain that the mother's rights override the rights of the fetus. I would be ashamed to live in a country that forced unwilling mothers to incubate babies they didn't want, effectively reducing them to subhumans whose bodies were at the mercy of someone else's whims. This sounds like a nightmare. The government has no right to tell you or any other citizen what medical procedures they  must  undergo or what medical procedures they  may not  undergo.    If a mother chooses not to take care of her child after she gives birth to it, she can be criminally prosecuted for criminal negligence.   The reason the mother is and should be culpable is that, at that point, the child  can  depend on someone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  able  to someone who will care for the child. Before the fetus is viable, it  cannot  depend on anyone else for life, so if she does not want the responsibility, she is  unable  to find anyone else who will finish the pregnancy for her. Abortion is currently the only option for women who do not want to remain pregnant; if there were some way to remove the fetus and put it in the body of a willing surrogate, I would be all for this.     And if she chooses to give the child away for abortion, then the child will still need the help of another foster mother for survival.   Since this is nonsense, I am going to assume you mean 'adoption' instead of 'abortion'. This does not change a single thing about my argument; at this point, the child can depend on someone but its biological mother for survival, so abortion is not necessary if the biological mother no longer wants to care for it.  --  In addition to my previous point, I would like to pose a hypothetical situation. Someone has a child. When their child is 10 years old, he becomes gravely ill. Only an organ transplant will save him. Unfortunately, the only person who can give him a matching organ in time is one of his parents. For whatever reason, the parent is unwilling to give their child the organ he needs. Should the government get involved and  force  one of the parents to give the child an organ, under threat of punishment? If yes, why draw the line at a parent-child situation? Why not force every citizen to have their unnecessary organs surgically removed and given to people on the donor list? If no, why not? After all, the humanhood and citizenship of people on the organ list is not even under debate, and you have shown you think it is okay to force people to conserve life/a living human at the expense of their own bodies.",

You are failing to understand that a parasite can only be from the animal kingdom and not the human kingdom because the fetus itself is from the family of homo sapiens. A parasite feeds from the host and also injures the host at the same time causing injury. There is no proof of that in a fetus.

Do not assume I don't understand what you are trying to say. It just irrelevant. Regardless of species, the fetus leeches nutrients from the mother and does not return them. Again, this is a parasitic relationship: one organism leeches from another without returning anything. Some definitions include the stipulation of separate species, and others do not. But either way, you cannot possibly argue that the fetus has anything to contribute to the biological relationship. It only takes, it does not return.

If I somehow find myself in a situation where my survival relies on using someone else's body as a host, then I absolutely support their right to terminate that dependency at the expense of my life, especially if I an incapable of thought or choice. This is why it does not matter to me if a fetus is considered human or not; the government should not force a citizen to sacrifice their right to bodily autonomy for the sake of another living thing, whether or not that living thing is a human. If they did, I don't see why we would not have mandatory organ harvesting from living donors.  2. Not all unwanted pregnancies result from unprotected sex. Also, the choice to have sex (unprotected or not) is not synonymous with the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, in the same way that choosing to smoke is not synonymous with choosing to let lung cancer run its course without seeking treatment.  3. I seriously doubt the validity of all those post-abortion statistics, as a few searches immediately turned up contradicting data. However, even if they are true, it is not the government's job to prevent people from making poor decisions. If it was, then, alcohol, cigarettes, extreme sports, body modification, and any number of 'regrettable' choices would be illegal. Sure, abortion could be safer, and pregnant women could be better educated and supported before and after they make the choice to continue their pregnancy or not. But there are more than sob stories for post-abortion women; there are plenty of women who were grateful for the choice and never looked back.",

I know far better than you I've had a pregnancy, I have a daughter, I have one of the greatest responsibilities an individual faces because I am a parent. Don't patronize me.

It's nice that you have to resort to name calling and insulting what a wonderful Christian you are! Why are you implying that every pregnant woman is some sort of whore.

You personally believe...but you still condone....yes, but no....but maybe..   You don't have to be completely decided on an argument since day one of this debate I stated it's neither right nor wrong it's based on  circumstance  and how the woman  feels . I don't condemn anyone who has abortion.   You gave devormity and imperfection as a valid reason for aborting. You personally wouldnt abort on these grounds.........well my dear what grounds would you kill?   I wouldn't have an abortion personally. Just because I think other people have the right doesn't mean I'd do it myself. The only reason I'd kill another person is to defend myself or my child.   I bring up Hitler because Margaret Sanger...influenced him and she was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Your views on this mirror theirs...because they acted them out. Do some research and you will see. Google...Sanger and Hitler...then see if you agree with them. If you don't I would like to know what you disagree with them on   Are you fucking kidding me? Here is one of Margaret's views  advocate abortions on Afro-Americans in order to eliminate what she called \"socially undesirable people\"  so I'm a racist now? And there is a massive difference here for a start. I don't believe anyone should be  forced  to have an abortion it's their  choice .   And another  She called for the halt to the medical care being given to slum mothers, and decried the expense to the taxpayers of monies being spent on the deaf, blind and dependent. She condemned foreign missionaries for reducing the infant mortality rates in developing countries, and declared charity to be more evil than for the assistance it provided to the poor and needy. Sanger's thinking moved to fascism in an elitist attitude that presumes to judge who is worthy to live and to die.   I don't agree with ANYTHING this woman promoted or believed. She didn't believe woman had the right to  choose  abortion she wanted to  force  them without a choice. She is racist scum and I have no common ground with any of these views. This is the most disgusting thing anyone has ever accused me of. How dare you?   You call me a pig and then tell me I am mean for comparing your views to Hitler? Come on.......   I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   Do you also support the women who are afraid and kill their born children...Do you also defend people who murder, rape, steal?........hell......you make excuses for everything. You are making excuses by simply not standing up for the unborn.   No I don't, they're not even the same thing. They're not the same circumstance. I don't make excuses I share my beliefs and opinions and they vary on all of these subjects. How is not condemning something making excuses. Not everyone has to agree with you, it's not the final word or the truth it's an  opinion .   You think its wrong to abort because the woman does not want stretch marks, it was the wrong sex .....but its ok, if its deformed.   Hold up! I didn't say it was wrong I said it was a little selfish. I never said she couldn't.   You said you would not deny a woman the right to kill, therefore you are pro-abortion, because your response does not defend the life of the ones being killed. You are like the person who drives them to get the abortion cause they have no car...and you think you did nothing to contribute to the killing.   You are a vile, horrible person to accuse someone of acts like this. How dare you say I contribute to abortion. If a woman asked me if she  should  have an abortion I'd say 'It's up to you, it's your choice'. I wouldn't judge her, I wouldn't influence her opinion. If someone is considering an abortion than they aren't anti-abortion anyway and pro-abortionists existing won't mean diddly squat to their decision.   What does pain have to do with anything? The point I was trying to make was...that you are probably pro-abortion UNTIL.......the time you think the fetus can feel pain. And geeze oh petes...we certainly dont want them to feel their skull being crushed do we? I mean that would be inhumane right? You are a joke.   Yes it would be inhumane to inflict pain onto a fetus in my opinion, hence I think it's okay before then. Pain has everything to do with it, if death wasn't painful people wouldn't be so scared of it. I don't have to be entirely pro abortion. Just like I wouldn't advocate theft but in a certain circumstance I would like if my daughter was starving I'd steal food for her without a second thought. Again thanks for the insult, what a wonderful Christian you are. You can act self-righteous and holier than thou but you are a terrible person verbally insulting people, demeaning them and being downright rude. Not to mention you lie. Very Godly.   You say the woman has the right to decide whether or not to kill her baby whatever the reason...(the man is not an issue unless money is involved)    Is that your opinion that a man is not involved unless it's money? You're wrong, having been pregnant and had a child my partners financial contribution to her life are the least meaningful thing, his love and nurturing for us throughout pregnancy and into life is. If you're lying again and claiming this is my opinion then again you're obviously very wrong.   after some date you randomly have thought up in your head to when the baby MIGHT be viable.   What? A date I randomly made up? No the youngest baby to live is 22 weeks that  is  the viable age as our medicine currently stands. And the second trimester is when a baby feels pain that is science, I linked you the information but it's clear you obviously don't read half of what people try to say to you.

Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it.   Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge.

According to your opinion, the fetus is a parasite but i challenge you to produce to me evidence pointing to the point that the fetus is a parasite. Those details i mentioned to you have been proved scientifically and if the courts have determined it as being a human life then how can you call it a parasite? So what if an organism takes and does not returns? Does it means that it is always a parasite? Again one of the laws of parasitism that the source has to be an outside source but in this case the fetus is from the body of the mother itsel. You seem to be confusing the terms parasitic with fetal. Because the relationship between a mother and a fetus can be described as being parasitic does it mean it is a parasitic relationship because what you are looking at is the deinition of the term itself and not the deeper contexts or elements involved in this relationship.   Abortion is still considered murder but is not being practised in society becuase of the ruling which was made in as much as the death penalty is part of the laws of New York but is not being practised. And if the fetus does not have life or killing a fetus is not considered legal then how come when a mother along with her fetus is killed, The District Attorney will charge the accused with double counts of homicide. One for the mother and one for the fetus. How is this psssible if the fetus is a parasite? And how does the human body not fight against the fetus but rather undergo changes to accept the fetus?  Abortion is murder and should not be given as a right to women. You need to be alive inorder to have have rights. Inorder to have life you must be able to be distinguished from the dead. Animals have lives but they are protected by rights. Right?  Thank you. You said it yourself. Your skin cells cannot develop into a human or heart so stop comparing it to a fetus.",

    "context": "No, I see abortion as acceptable up until a certain point and evil after another point. You forgot to listen to me again. The gray area is that the overall event of abortion can be good or evil, either black or white, therefore it in itself is gray if you look at it in it's entirety.  Cultures that think it is acceptable to invariably harm the existence of an innocent human being are either going to collapse because they're psychopathic, or they're going to collapse because they are overall brainwashed into not believing that the act of rape doesn't invariably harm a human being. Stop acting like there are tons of cultures that think murder and torture and rape are right, because there aren't. Cannibalism isn't common because only psychopaths and stone age cultures commonly practice it. The same goes for rape and murder. You think murder is acceptable in a place like China or Kuwait because they have different cultures then us? It isn't. Because culture does not bypass morality. The human mind does.  Evil, in a way, is in the eye of the beholder. But harm is not. If you negatively effect the existence of a human being, you are harming it. Whether you think you are harming them or not does not change the fact that you harm them. The ability to attempt perceive this is programmed into our brains through morality. What you need to understand is that harm is infallible. It doesn't matter if Hitler's Nazis thought they were murdering evil Jewish people, because they were, in truth, harming the existence of the human race by deriving it of millions of people. Just because a group of Christians beat a person with turrets to death because they think he's possessed doesn't mean they didn't harm the existence of that human being, disabled or not. Harm is not subjective. It is a state of existence beyond the ability to perceive.   It's radical to say something is totally wrong when many things are not totally wrong depending on the circumstance.  Stop calling you names? No. You look foolish for obviously being close-minded and not even being able to understand anything I'm saying.   My example is NOT sick, you are just a neophyte with no imagination! You think it's wrong, no matter the circumstance, for a perfectly sane and conscious adult to have sex with a perfectly sane, conscious, AND consenting teenager? I said teenager, not child, and there's a difference. Does your morality really only go so far as the law does? What's the difference between a consenting adult and 17 year old having sex and a consenting adult and an 18 year old having sex? The difference is that the law says one is abhorrently wrong... which is, in fact, bullshit. Having sex with someone extremely young is wrong because the child is not consenting and/or under agreement and/or understanding the circumstance in the first place. A teenager at a certain age has the capacity for all of the same things an adult has, including love, judgment, knowledge, awareness, coordination, everything. And if the teenager is a little young and  doesn't  have have all these things, they have almost all of these things. Who are you to dictate that love is wrong based on law or order? Consenting, mutual love is beautiful and chaotic and knows no boundaries. Which brings me to a question for you... if a 90 year old and 60 year old fall in love, is that wrong? There's a 30 year difference, as where a 14 year old and 18 year old have only a 4 year difference. It's illegal for that 18 and 14 year old to fall in love and exercise their love, so why shouldn't the love between a 90 and 60 year old be illegal to exercise physically? Do you not see the whole in that logic? A consenting, understanding person is a consenting, understanding person regardless of age. Children are never consenting and understanding people in regards with sex. Some underage teenagers, on the other hand,  are , by mathematical probability. Mutual, understanding, consenting love shouldn't be restricted by the law, and if you have any compassion, you'll have an imagination and agree with me.  Facts I know about abortion? Facts about abortion are that the fetus does not have brain waves, and therefore a consciousness, until a certain stage in the pregnancy. That's a fact. Duh. I've said that about a dozen times to you. It's funny how you've showed your obliviousness to everything I've been saying by asking for the facts I've been repeating to you over and over again.  Yes, the fact is that a fetus, after a certain point, is a human being. It has a consciousness. Before that certain point, it has no consciousness. Now, I'm going to ask this next question with my caps lock and italics on:  WHAT IS YOUR PROOF THAT A FETUS IS A HUMAN BEING BEFORE IT HAS A CONSCIOUSNESS?  I agree that a fetus with a consciousness is a human being. You think that it's always a human being, period. Give me proof that it is a human being, period, regardless of having a consciousness or not.  I'm not 'pro-abortion'. I have said this multiple times and my ideas are not 'pro-abortion'. Stop saying that I'm 'pro-abortion' before I decide to call you a dumb twat, you oblivious nincompoop.   Yup, I'm God. Everything is God. You're God to, you know.  No, it is a fact that under certain circumstances, sex with a teenager does not harm the teenager or adult, therefore it is not wrong. If it doesn't harm them, how is it wrong?  Cheating can be wrong because it harms the emotions of your spouse or mate, depending on their mentality. Some people don't mind open relationships because they aren't emotionally damaged by cheating. Therefore, for them, cheating is not wrong.  The same applies to lying and stealing. Example for lying: You're a Jew living in Germany. It's 1938. You look a little more German then Jewish. Nazis ask you if you and your family are Jewish. You lie and say you're not Jewish. You save your family and yourself. If you think that lie was wrong, you are a naive, brainwashed fool. Have an imagination that factors in circumstance.  Example of stealing: you're poor and starving. So is your family. A rich man leaves his car unlocked. His wallet with 1000 dollars is in the unlocked car. You steal the money and leave the wallet. You stop your family and you from starving to death long enough to get a job. If you think stealing in that case was wrong, then you apparently are so brainwashed as to not believe in the morality of  Robin Hood .  Child abuse is never wrong, because it's abuse. Abuse is to harm someone for no reason. Harm is infallible. Child abuse is never right.  I do not defend evil. I defend only good. You are just a humongous idiot. In fact, YOU defend evil if you think that the Jew in 1938 shouldn't have lied, if you think the stealing man shouldn't have feed his family, and if the 18 year old with a 14 year old lover should go to jail for the rest of your life.   Do you support these things? I hope you say no.  In the case that you say yes, you are an evil piece of shit. You believe in harming people just because the law tells you to harm people. In which case, you deserve the Hell of the black and white Christianity you so believe in.  But, I don't even think YOU are brainwashed enough to say 'yes'. I'm glad you won't.  You failed to understand what I said, AGAIN. Fool. People who are unconscious still have a consciousness. When you sleep, your brain is a billion times more active then when you're awake. The same goes for comas. They have a consciousness, and therefore we KNOW that they have a soul. A fetus, on the other hand, is not 'unconscious' at every stage of the pregnancy. To be unconscious, you must  have a consciousness in the first place . Until a certain point, a fetus has no consciousness, therefore it is not 'unconscious'. It has no soul.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE TO ME THAT IT HAS A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   Of course your baby would do that, it was the size of a melon and had awareness despite being inside you still! It was human! But you know what? It wasn't human the second it's halves came together and fertilized.  UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE THAT IT HAD A SOUL WITHOUT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS .   No. YOU are sad. You are the saddest sad person to ever be sad. You're the coldest thing to ever exist. My mother died in a car accident at the age of 73. We kept her body alive on life support for a week and pulled the plug after coming to terms with the fact that she was dead when her brain died.   You despicable c-... No, I'll stop from saying that insult. But you are despicable. Vegetable people are masses of meat without any consciousness. They are not comatose... they are not UNCONSCIOUS. They have NO CONSCIOUSNESS WHATSOEVER. I feel sad for you, being such a fool as to think that keeping a conscious-less piece of meat alive is right. To classify a conscious-less piece of meat as a human being is correct.  How about we classify severed limbs as people to, then huh? Then people won't ever be allowed to amputate their arms if they have leprosy. Instead they'll have to die because of some illogical horseshit law that dictates that their arm may not be amputated because their arm is a human being.   I'd say screw you, but you know what... I don't need to. Your life is bound to be ruined in the long run if you are so ignorantly brainwashed as you are. A soul can only be logically measured by the presence of consciousness.   PROVE TO ME THAT A SOUL CAN EXIST IN HUMAN FLESH WITHOUT IT HAVING A CONSCIOUSNESS.   Do it!   Because if you can't, you CANNOT prove me wrong and never will!",

Human beings are moral agents, moral agents are moral because we are perceivers and valuers, the ability to perceive and value is only possible when we are conscious. it is therefore our being consciousnes that gives us moral agency.   Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term \"human-being\" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness. For females that are too young to be mothers due to their immaturity as humans - generally thought of as anything younger than the age of majority (18) but also could extend to any age since mental and emotional maturity are only related to age in childhood adolescence and young adulthood - the potential life of the child has a 98-99% chance of being very impoverished both developmentally and with regards to being a productive member of society. The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. \"Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection\" is a bad way to think of it.  So I say ...  - Be moral, have an abortion (not a joke)",

I think war is bad, but it can still be valid. I think people being a dick is bad, but I think it is their right. There's lots of things I don't like that I would still support.

No, I do not. Without being an expert in biology, I'm leaning towards a 'first trimester' option, to me that seems to be the commonly accepted medical grounds. Makes sense, after that the foetus becomes too lifelike, and the emotional trauma is too great. Also, how could you possibly give her the right the whole way through, when she's in labour, that's ridiculously impossible. A time limit makes sense.   We are given life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in our Constitution   No, you are. I am not American. Please do not assume that everyone you meet on the internet is American, especially when I've written so in my 'about me'.  Yes, but the constitution is a legal document, it can easily be flawed. Just because it's there doesn't make it right, you must verify what you say.  And further, if you did accept it as truth, that only applies to citizens. When a foetus has citizenship, it gains the right to life. To do that, it must be born.

Currently most insurance companies cover reproductive services, chances are the insurance you have now either through your parents or employer provides reproductive services that includes abortion. But it isn't taken from your taxes, you or your parents or your employer is  now  paying for abortions.  The new laws are the same thing it looks like. Women can choose to get reproductive services, the money is pooled as is the case with all insurance, and that may be one of the services covered. However, it is only covered if one pays into the system - they are paying for it.  It's the status quo, and the abortion subject was only brought up to rile up the misinformed. What Republicans and some Democrats  tried  to slip into the new legislation was basically a ban on all abortion. They tried to use the bill as an excuse to make it harder for poor people to get abortions. That's all it was.  The fact remains though, that even if that were to happen, if they were able to make it harder for poor people to get abortions, it just means women getting the procedure in other ways that are often dangerous. Never in history has making abortion illegal, or even more expensive, stopped abortion.  You should be happy though. Now you get to stay on your parent's plan for a few more years if you are in a situation where you do not have an employer who provides insurance.  And if your child goes to college someday, they will be able to stay on your policy while in school all the way till age 27 I believe... maybe 26.  On top of that, it will be less expensive as soon as the millions of self-employed who aren't sick but still can't afford a private plan will be paying into the system.

Does a man make a conscious decision to have sex and deposit his sperm in the woman? Does he know that the woman has a possibility to get pregnant? Does he know that if she were to get pregnant the woman would have the right to abort? Yes he knows all of these things. And yet he still chooses to impregnate a woman. Therefore he is half responsible. He is not stupid he knows the risk just as much as the woman and takes the responsibility just as much as the woman.   I believe personally that the man should be considered....   If the man is to be considered then he has to be considered on  all grounds . Which means if his opinion was taken into consideration by  law  then he could force a woman to abort a fetus that she wanted to have. Seeing as you're anti-abortion wouldn't that bother you?   Like I said today she can kill and he need not even know it. I talk to men all the time whose wives or girlfriends got an abortion behind their backs   Well if they talk about it they obviously know about it.   You said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfair........why?   I said what's unfair?   Am I calling names?   Here's a list! Directly copied and pasted from what you have said to me. Is this what the word of Jesus taught you do? Name call?  Materialist  Judge mental  You look silly  your ignorant  You are cold.  You champion killing  sissy  Hitler, Margaret Sanger. Your views on this mirror theirs.  You are a joke  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so ridiculous it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even funny  you respresent death to innocent human beings    Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call me a pig? Better reread that section   You deserved to be called a pig. I hate sexism. I'd call you a pig if your were racist or homophobic, being sexist is discriminating and holds the same grounds to me. Oh and perhaps  you  re-read that section because here is what I said    I never denied that I called you a name. Hypocrite. All you've done since this debate began is name call, I will retaliate.   I'm not the one in denial. I called you a pig once. You've demeaned and name called multiple times.   You said yourself that you believe for whatever reason\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that abortion should be legal and an option for any woman should she need it.   I know and your point is?   Most abortions happen on unwed women....women mainly who profess to be Christian in fact. That does not change the fact how they got pregnant. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you describe it for us in more politically correct terms? It still won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change the truth of how it happened.   What on earth are you on about? I've had sex I know what sex entails, I know how a child is conceived. You said this  It got there sissy because she opened her legs and allowed sperm to swim inside her. She is the one taking the risk...not the man  This is SEXIST, you think a man has no responsibility for getting a woman pregnant. Of course he does. Could a woman get pregnant without a man? No. Therefore the man HAS to assume HALF the responsibility for a child being conceived. There are two things that create a life, an egg and a sperm. Half and half. They  both  decide to have sex, they  both  know the risks, they  both  procreate. They are  both  responsible.   As I said AGAIN\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.the man is an onlooker so says the law\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.that is if he is not married   An unmarried man has the same say as a married man by law. For someone who claims that I know nothing on the law of abortion you sure know bugger all yourself.   girl who is allowing him in   The man also allows himself in. Stop implying the girl is always the instigator of sex. If the man didn't want to have sex and ejaculate in her then it would be rape. If he didn't want to get her pregnant he could have said no or used a condom. Just as the girl could say no or use a condom. They both take equal blame.   Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you have the guts to call it like it is? If the man is accountable wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he have a decision in the pregnancy?   How, explain to me how scientifically a man is not responsible for pregnancy? That is how it is I'm afraid. It takes a man and a woman to procreate. They both did it. He doesn't have a decision in pregnancy by law because....oh God do I have to repeat myself AGAIN...because if he chose for her to abort when she didn't want to he would be forcing her. It's not the man who has to carry the baby for 9 months. And if you READ what I say... most fathers  do  have a say because the mother and father will come to a mutual agreement.   As for condemning anyone for an abortion\u00e2\u0080\u00a6this discussion is not about that   Seriously? All you've done is called everyone names and demeaned and condemned them for believing a woman has a right to abortion.   because I know what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like, I had one   I'm sorry about the fact you had one but it doesn't mean I can't look past the fact you are a complete hypocrite. How dare you tell me I contribute to abortion and patronize me like that when I've never done anything to contribute to abortion and you've had one.    I was one of those women who spread her legs. It was my call, my responsibility and the pain and agony I suffered was on me as it should be.   In a sense I'm beginning to feel like you have had some strange notions thrust upon you. And I actually feel very sorry for you. Someone has clearly put it into your head that you are bad person or a whore or something. The person who had sex with you and created your child is half responsible. It takes two people to make a child. You cannot create a life on your own.   So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me or begin to know about how it feels or what someone goes through   Again stop lying about things I've said. I never said I did, in fact this seems to be a trait that a lot of Americans have that I hate. Telling someone 'I know how you feel'.   I see the pain, especially afterwards   I have friends and family who have had abortions I would never claim to know how they felt, they talk about it and of course most of them are distraught. It's abortion. I never said it was happy fairy la la land. However they could have felt worse if they had a child. What about mothers who are forced into keeping a child and are miserable, unable to love the child? Do their emotions mean nothing?   but by the boyfriends, the husbands the children   I'm not denying it isn't an upsetting process, stop assuming you know everything about my opinion when I haven't even spoken a word about this. Who in their right mind would tell a child they aborted their sibling? How selfish.    I would give anything to be able to take that day back\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and I know hundreds and hundreds of women who feel the same way   I'm sure there are plenty of woman who feel they did the right thing too.   You are pro-choice whether you want to believe it or not\u00e2\u0080\u00a6BECAUSE YOU SIMPLY CONDONE OTHERS the right to kill   Not pro-choice thanks. I have a limit. That's like saying 'you're a speeder and broke the law because you drive fast even thought it's within the speed limit!' It makes no sense.   Were the people that stood by and did nothing about those who were marched into Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ovens\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 pro-life?   What has the holocaust got to do with abortion. Since they felt pain and were living, viable humans this has no relation to my opinion.   How about those people that owned slaves? Would you have owned a slave or condoned someone else owning one?   Again what does having a slave have to do with abortion. Of course I wouldn't and I wouldn't condone it but you're just talking about meaningless jargon now.   And do you have to use the F bomb in order to debate? Is it an effective way to get your point across?   I sure has hell do when someone accuses me of being a racist murderer.   Of course you will retaliate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you condone abortion which is violence.   I don't think calling someone a pig is violent, how did you come to that conclusion?   You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so ridiculous it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not even funny. Bolonga\u00e2\u0080\u00a6many people are afraid of death because they do not know what is beyond it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.not just because of pain   I didn't say pain is the  only  reason people are scared of death. Stop lying. I'm not scared of what's beyond it, I don't believe in religious afterlife in a heaven and hell sense. And if it  was  true, which I don't believe it is, everyone I love and know has already been condemned to hell in the eyes of God, I'd rather be there supporting my friends and family than sitting in heaven with you.   I was making an analogy that you simply did not like. Well does the person who takes the money for the killing contribute? How about the nurse that hands the abortionist the tool that crushes the skull?   You accused me of having the same views as a Nazi, you accused me of being a racist murderer. And now you think beecause people perform abortions and assist them they are Nazi's? By the way I am none of these examples and I've never contributed to an abortion. Do you think you are a Nazi and a racist murderer? Since you had an abortion? Abortions are free here. And I also think you've got the abortion operation all wrong. They aren't performed like that anymore.  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abortion/Pages/How-is-it-performed.aspx    Then you judge me when you think I retaliate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.why are you judging me from different standards than you live by\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6   You name called, you didn't retaliate you instigated. Since revenge is against God's will wouldn't you be sinning  again  if it had of been retaliation. I'm not judging you by different standards or religion. I'm just telling you what the Bible says, isn't that what happens at church every time you go? Are they judging you?   So you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like how I put things\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..Christ said, they hated me first and will hate you as well.   No I just don't want to be quoted scripture since I don't believe in it as the divine truth. It's worthless quoting the Bible to me. I will only accept proven fact as a reliable source.   I am not demeaning anyone but stating the truth   Refer back to my list of insults and things you have compared me to.   BUT HE WOULD BE HELD legally responsible for child support if HE DID NOT WANT THE CHILD AND WANTED HER TO GET AN ABORTION   Good. If they were married like you stated he wouldn't be paying child support anyway.   Well you are wrong again\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Elgin_Gill   128 days early\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or 21 weeks 5 days early    http://www.jillstanek.com/archives/2007/                                        02/worlds_youngest.htm   Actually she is. Are you really going to be that pedantic that you will argue I was one day out on her age. Why don't you produce a real argument?   There are babies like this all over the world being born. My niece was born 23 weeks 4 days. She spent five months in the hospital but is perfect today at 18 years old. She weighed just over 1 pound.   For the final time read what I say. Or I'm just going to ignore you and watch you continuing to manipulate the truth and lie. I said I don't believe abortion should be allowed past the second trimester as that is when the fetus feels pains. Unless it's a medical reason for the mother or baby.   I know the information out there\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you need to get educated and read a bit more, instead of just google and posting.   Why because you post things from Wikipedia?

Everything else is  my  words. You ask for evidence you get it.   You value your own child and don't care about another in the womb....?????   I don't really feel the 'worldwide love'. I love my family and friends. That is it. I am not religious or spiritual I do not feel compelled to love anyone other than the people I feel genuine love for. I do not love you, I do not love strangers whether they be child, adult, fetus. At best I like some random people. That does not mean I don't value other people though, I value good people, respectful people, kind people, intelligent people e.t.c   Yea that is odd for someone who would stand by while another child was slaughtered. Just makes it all better if you know it is painless for that fetus at 22 weeks, right?   What do you want me to do set fire to the abortion clinics? Did you want me to pioneer a revolution? Do you want to preach to people? Sorry I won't and I can't. If I saw an actual baby or child I'd intervene with their death. But what the hell is someone meant to do about a fetus. Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp.

Tie the mother up and feed her through a drip until she gives birth?   Fuck sakes, read my words PLEASE. When does the second trimester begin? 12 weeks that's when a baby feels pain, derp. I already said that about 6 times?",

Prior to and independent of our consciousness (and by consiousness, I mean both waking and sleeping levels), our bodies are only able to be classified as human insofar as moral agency is concerned. The term \"human-being\" really only applies to humans that embody all the distinctions which are sufficient for moral agency. It is only then that we are truly identifiable as human-beings. a hand that is detached is not a human being, an eye, an ear, a heart, leg, etc... these are all just part of the whole, and even when assembled we are not yet a person unless we have the conscious element.   Since consciousness only becomes possible at the onset of the third trimester ~ 26 weeks, it is immoral to kill, what I would then call a child. Prior to consciousness the fetus is a fetus, not having moral agency because it lacks the sufficient condition of personhood. Many people like to think about potentiality arguments with regard to a fetus, that it could become conscious. However, potential doesnt relate to the here and now and are therefore invalid insofar as the moral status of the action (abortion) is concerned.   Potentiality arguments actually are appropriate as justifications contrary to pro-life opinions because they are valid when speaking of a fetus that will not be aborted, this is because it will almost certainly gain consciouness.

The potential life will likely suck a lot.   Thus...   If moral agency is not established and the life will likely suck, abortion is the ideal choice. Abortion is an a-moral action (not having moral status) prior to the onset of consciousness. So in light of this people should be having more abortions. I think it is more responsible to abort a child that is unwanted and who's life will probably suck, than it is to not. the notion of responsibility should always be predicated upon the quality of the potential child's life - if its life will likely be impoverished it is irresponsible to have it. \"Taking responsibility for the mistake of not using protection\" is a bad way to think of it.

What about babies outside of the womb who are newborn? They lack rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness.   No, they don't. According to the OED, autonomy is defined as \"a. The condition of being controlled only by its own laws, and not subject to any higher one. b. Organic independence.\" A baby that is born do have autonomy.  Self-consciousness is defined, according to the OED, as \"Consciousness of one's own identity, one's acts, thoughts, etc.\" As long as one has knowledge of what one is doing, he/she is said to possess self-consciousness. A baby that is born can said to have self-consciousness.   2. I think it's morally neutral in these cases. If between a rock and a hard place, where the doctor has to make a life-or-death call, it would be morally permissible (not good or evil) to do so.   It between \"a rock and a hard place\" is not the same as moral neutrality. Furthermore, morally permissible is not morally neutral. You are contradicting yourself here.   3. I think you misread it because your response agrees with me. The issue is whether or not abortion is murder. Legality and morality are separate, of course, but legality should flow out of morality.   Yes, it seems like I have misread your statement. I apologise for that. And I agree with what you have said about legality and morality.   4. No, except in life-or-death cases as stated above.   However, you haven't provided any good arguments to exclude all the other cases from being morally permissible.   5. But neither is it the fault of the child. It's unfortunate, but the mother being wronged in no way makes it morally acceptable for her to thereby wrong the baby.   First, the fetus is neither a \"child\" nor a \"baby\". Thus, your entire argument is moot. Second, while I agree that the injustice accrued to someone is not justification for that person to wrong any one else, you are assuming that the fetus has the same rights as the mother. As I have said, since the fetus is not a person, it would be fallacious to accrue the same rights to a fetus as you would any other person.",

There are many women, who suffer from various hazardous medical conditions such as heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia, severe diabetes, etc. As these diseases can be life-threatening, an abortion often helps to avoid serious medical complications from childbirth.

Adaptation - ability to change over time in response to environment  6. Response to stimuli - reacting to outside objects (recoiling when poked, etc)  7. Reproduction - ability to produce more organisms  From the moment of conception, the new cell has all of these attributes. It fits into the definition of life.  The new cell also has a unique genetic code not found in the mother.  Therefore, given the definition of life and the fact that the new life has a differing genetic code from its mother we can conclude that it is a separate human being in early stages of development. As a separate human being it has the same worth and rights as any other human being.  If this is true no other arguments matter. Size, stage of growth (children are less developed than adults, are they less than human?), and location do not matter at all.

    "context": "You mentioned the term parasite so my question to you is does parasites posess the DNA which identifies us each as a human? And if the fetus is indeed a parasite then how come it belongs to the race of homo sapiens referred to as humans? To the extent of my knowledge i was taught that parasites feed from their host in return causing injury to the host which is completely the opposite in terms of the fetus.  A fetus is formed from a sperm cell and a egg cell which identifies it as a developing human with developing organs. If the fetus is indeed a parasite then you are implying that all humans are parasites at the fetal stage and any doctors or scientist will prove you wrong.   The body of a woman is not infringed upon because the fetus is formed from a natural process of reproduction which involves the reproduction of human organisms developing into human beings. Parasites are formed from foreign materials that enter the body but the fetus is formed from the cells of the human body itself which makes it a special function of the sex organs of the human body.  Also you said that people who are caretakers of other people can denounce their rights to take care of that person who is paralyzed but what happens if that person signs a irrevocable power of attorney to stand for the person giving power of attorney. In this case it is a permanent legal contract between the appearer and the person recieving power. And even if this person recuses himself or herself from taking care of the paralyzed person wouldn't that person also depend on the help of doctors to survive? And what about newborns that are one day old? Don't they also feed from the body of the mother? Does that makes them a parasite?",

So when you have kids and they hit puberty, because of your \"neutrality\" mentality you'll tell them to do whatever they'd like, regardless of what's smart, responsible, or sensible? Good luck making tough decisions in life, my friend.  You seem to base your argument for neutrality off of logic. You say that neutrality is logical. I disagree. In an earlier post, I made a spirited argument of why logically, abortion is wrong, because according to the laws of reason that govern this earth, every action has a consequence, and to say that just because you don't want to face that consequence does not mean you don't have to.",

    "context": "\"Murder is an act which is committed upon persons. A fetus is not a person. Have you ever accidentally cut off a sliver of your skin? You've just killed more cells in that act than the typical abortion.\"   This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I see the zygote as human life. Not a cell that is part of a mammal. The zygote, if allowed to continue growing naturally, will become a human being. Therefore, to terminate this human life is murder.   \"However, you are self aware of this journey. A fetus isn't even aware that it is alive. It is a mass of cells with minimal brain tissue if any exists at all.\"   This is rather dangerous thinking. Whether a the fetus is self-aware or not does not prove or disprove it's humanity. I take it you are gun-ho on euthanasia, possibly even as radical as Peter Singer on these issues.   \"Life for us legally begins at birth. Practically speaking it begins when we are first self-aware, which is well beyond the mere fetus stage.\"   What you fail to realize is that I am not concerned with the legality of this concept of life. this is a profound moral issue.   You keep harping the point that life begins at the stage of self-awareness. This is very comical because technically we don't know when that is yet, and we may never know. So to base your argument for the beginning of life on an assumption makes for a very weak point.   \"Taking your argument to extremes, every skin cell is a potential life, ready for propagation through activation of totipotentcy and cloning, or enucleation of a host zygote, insertion of your purified DNA and implantation into a host uterus. Every time you shed dander you are a mass murderer, congratulations.\"   The zygote that results from intercourse naturally will form into a fetus. Dander will not naturally form into a fetus, unless one goes through means of the things that you've just described; man-made, unnatural means. That's the difference.    \"It's a womans' rights issue because to be a part of a free society means having ownership and jurisprudence over your own body.\"   Sure, up until the point where there is another human life inside that body. There are now two humans rather than one. What about the right of the human inside the woman? You seem to ignore that human's rights.      \"you are overstepping your boundaries and effectively hijacking her reproductive organs for your own moral agenda.\"   And the woman who has an abortion essentially agrees to assist a doctor in murdering her child by sucking it's brains out. This, of course, is for her own selfish, arrogant, and unethical agenda.   \"Maybe you would have empathy for women on this topic if political activists were campaigning to take control of your ejaculations, arguing that a single sperm is a life\"   When you find a human being that came from a single sperm alone, let me know. Otherwise, what you just typed is ridiculous. No one would possibly even argue that under any circumstances (except you of course).",
