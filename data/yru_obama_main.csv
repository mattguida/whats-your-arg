You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare.  link   You sound very uninformed.

GM specifically was 17 months away from bankruptcy and now it's stocks are soaring and it has already paid back $11.8 billion to tax payers, 5 years ahead of schedule. Of the bank bailouts 66% of it has been paid back already. These averted bankruptcy and saved millions of jobs. Had we have let these industries go bankrupt, unemployment would have rocketed to levels not seen since the last great depression.

oba132,"Oh Yea, there is something obvious that I forgot in my original point, or points:     Borrowing money. Borrowing money from people who print money and devalue their currency is just as bad a printing money. Actually it's worse, it' puts you in debt the your borrowers i.e. China. Only if every country is free of debt to another will they truly be free.   Just like there are casualties of ware over territory,security, goods and other things, now there is a different war over debt that may require casualties in the name of true freedom. Though these will not be as obvious as soldiers on the battlefeild. They will be the ones who die due to cuts in medical programs and welfare programs. Medicare, Medicaid, and social security are the biggest share of our debt and we keep borrowing money from countries with no working standards or conditions to avoid the inevitable. The pay out that will leave us all broke. When the elderly outnumber the people working to support them. Or better their bills outnumber the wages of those who support them.   Freedom comes at a cost. Only those who are willing to make the sacrifices will get it.   So far I see Obama is willing to make some sacrifices, but not the tough ones. Tough ones are required to climb out of the hole which we have dug. The borrowing has to stop. The printing has to stop. Or we will never get out.   I'm sorry that's just what logic dictates.

oba160,"in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important.   Bill Clinton had a different view on things. It was about having taxes that can match the spending. However, if spending is out of control, increasing taxes doesn't help. this is why Clinton cut spending so much that taxes could actually be cut instead of needing any raise, while still having an annual surplus.   My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me.   You're ignoring some of my points on a voucher program, but even so, it makes little sense to reward others for doing nothing. As well, as explained, government services provide a lot less to the public than private services. This is simply because pursuit of wealth increases overall wealth. People have more in Capitalistic countries than in Collectivist countries. This is what the USSR witnessed when they privatized more industries, and this was the BIGGEST realization for China as they went from Communist to practically Laissez-Faire economics.     Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality.   Socialistic policies do not increase the amount of goods and services available to people (unless you include Militaristic policies that have been the only historical instance where massive government spending has actually benefited the citizens in in their wants). Food and clean water supply goes up with private industries' efforts to make more money. Consumers want goods and services, private forces provide them.  If you're worried about the poor, a voucher program (that would cut down spending and regulation greatly) would benefit them far more than a public service. Vouchers would give them the ability to choose at little to no cost to themselves. However, socialistic policies of government services and regulation only make things harder for the poor.   Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   I've given my explanation on Scandanavia and PrayerFails has given a different but also effective one as well. Wealth equality doesn't mean jack shit if the overall wealth is still low.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform   The current Ryan plan is to appeal to the Mainstream Democrats who hated his voucher program for healthcare.   over-regulation is one of them   general regulation does this. Unless you mean regulation ONLY in rich neighborhoods...    The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.   It came from government incentives to ""look out for the poor"" who were actually the risky loans. It came from government taxes on businesses that didn't make these high risks.    Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   I feel that you completely ignored my points that regulators should have no say in any of the business of the banks, and that general government should give absolutely no rewards to banks for any reasons. No subsidies, no tax incentives, no regulation, no interest fondling, and no bail-outs. Government should view banks as another business and should have no concern for them. This will remove their power over all of us who depend greatly on government currency yet require private industries to provide us with this government provision.   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   Explain.   I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately.   Why? forgive me, but this may just be my issue with debate in general, when others look to their pastors and school teachers as experts on very complex issues (especially to justify the surrendering of liberty for the sake of security that has never been shown to exist or be successful).   but the commentary they provide is not worthless.

Due to his diligence and vision, we are now beginning to 'see the light', in spite of the non-cooperative Congress he is working with. If you know anything about American politics, you realize, the President's power are limited, and dependent upon Congress. In other words, even if his policies were 'perfect', if Congress decided not to support them, they would go no where.

They are counting this as an accomplishment?  1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House  I like this one.  1.Limits on White House aides working for lobbyists after their tenure in the administration  There are still loop holes but if this policy works I'll give him credit.   1.Ended the previous stop-loss policy that kept soldiers in Iraq/Afghanistan longer than their enlistment date   McCain might have done something like this, but I'll give Obama credit.  1.Phasing out the expensive F-22 war plane and other outdated weapons systems, which weren't even used or needed in Iraq/Afghanistan  1.Removed restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research   1.Federal support for stem-cell and new biomedical research   I don't mind stem-cell research, but tax payers should not pay for it.    1.New federal funding for science and research labs   Not their job to do so.  1.States are permitted to enact federal fuel efficiency standards above federal standards  I would respect this if he had a consistent record as to what the states are allowed to.  1.Increased infrastructure spending (roads, bridges, power plants) after years of neglect   1.Funds for high-speed, broadband Internet access to K-12 schools   Not government's job.   1.New funds for school construction   Not government's job, the schools still suck anyways.    1.The prison at Guantanamo Bay is being phased out   This one is just fucking retarded and is nothing more then a PR move. If he wants to change the prison's policies then that is one thing, but closing down a prison only to send the prisoners elsewhere is just stupid.    1.US Auto industry rescue plan   Propping up failing companies is not an accomplishment.    1.Housing rescue plan   He still needs to fix Fannie and Freddie.   1.$789 billion economic stimulus plan   The tax cut parts were good, the rest not so much.   1.The public can meet with federal housing insurers to refinance (the new plan can be completed in one day) a mortgage if they are having trouble paying   1.US financial and banking rescue plan   Not government's job.  1.The secret detention facilities in Eastern Europe and elsewhere are being closed  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy; the US now has a no torture policy and is in compliance with the Geneva Convention standards  Good   1.Better body armor is now being provided to our troops   McCain would have done the same.  1.The missile defense program is being cut by $1.4 billion in 2010  Good.   1.Restarted the nuclear nonproliferation talks and building back up the nuclear inspection infrastructure/protocols   New policy with new president, nothing special.  1.Reengaged in the treaties/agreements to protect the Antarctic  Protect it from what?   1.Reengaged in the agreements/talks on global warming and greenhouse gas emissions   More bull shit regulations from self righteous environmentalists.    1.Visited more countries and met with more world leaders than any president in his first six months in office   And now they like us more... so what?    1.Successful release of US captain held by Somali pirates; authorized the SEALS to do their job   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to have the SEALS do their job?   1.US Navy increasing patrols off Somali coast   Do you really think that a Republican would have hesitated to increased military presence?    1.Attractive tax write-offs for those who buy hybrid automobiles   Preferential treatment to his environmental followers is not an accomplishment.    1.Cash for clunkers program offers vouchers to trade in fuel inefficient, polluting old cars for new cars; stimulated auto sales   Not the government's job, no way to pay for the program, Japan automakers love us now.  1.Announced plans to purchase fuel efficient American-made fleet for the federal government   1.Expanded the SCHIP program to cover health care for 4 million more children   Not government's job.   1.Signed national service legislation; expanded national youth service program   Not government's job.   1.Instituted a new policy on Cuba, allowing Cuban families to return home to visit loved ones   He could just lift the ban on Cuba altogether seeing as it hurts the Cuban people more then it hurts their government.    1.Ended the previous policy of not regulating and labeling carbon dioxide emissions   Not government's job.   1.Expanding vaccination programs   And wasting millions in the process on unused vaccines.    1.Immediate and efficient response to the floods in North Dakota and other natural disasters   MSNBC was criticizing the government for not doing anything, enforcing something like this after you are chewed out is not an accomplishment.   1.Closed offshore tax safe havens  Good.  1.Negotiated deal with Swiss banks to permit US government to gain access to records of tax evaders and criminals  Good.  1.Ended the previous policy of offering tax benefits to corporations who outsource American jobs; the new policy is to promote in-sourcing to bring jobs back  Good.  1.Ended the previous practice of protecting credit card companies; in place of it are new consumer protections from credit card industry's predatory practices  Good.   1.Energy producing plants must begin preparing to produce 15% of their energy from renewable sources   Not government's job.   1.Lower drug costs for seniors   Not government's job.  1.Ended the previous practice of forbidding Medicare from negotiating with drug manufacturers for cheaper drugs; the federal government is now realizing hundreds of millions in savings  Good   1.Increasing pay and benefits for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved housing for military personnel   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Initiating a new policy to promote federal hiring of military spouses   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Improved conditions at Walter Reed Military Hospital and other military hospitals   McCain would have done something similar.   1.Increasing student loans   Not government's job, not only that but they have failed to address growing tuition costs which negates the benefits of increasing loans.  1.Increasing opportunities in AmeriCorps program  Ehhh, sure, I like this one.  1.Sent envoys to Middle East and other parts of the world that had been neglected for years; reengaging in multilateral and bilateral talks and diplomacy  Good   1.Established a new cyber security office   And now he wants the government to be able to take control of the internet in case of ""emergency"".   1.Beginning the process of reforming and restructuring the military 20 years after the Cold War to a more modern fighting force; this includes new procurement policies, increasing size of military, new technology and cyber units and operations, etc.   New president, new policy.   1.Ended previous policy of awarding no-bid defense contracts  Good   1.Ordered a review of hurricane and natural disaster preparedness   Sounds like something any president would do.   1.Established a National Performance Officer charged with saving the federal government money and making federal operations more efficient    1.Students struggling to make college loan payments can have their loans refinanced   Not government's job, if they really gave a shit then they would have fixed the problem of the rising costs of college, but seeing as the left is in love with academia I doubt that will happen.   1.Improving benefits for veterans   McCain.   1.Many more press conferences and town halls and much more media access than previous administration   Narcissism is not an accomplishment.   1.Instituted a new focus on mortgage fraud  Good.   1.The FDA is now regulating tobacco   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.    1.Ended previous policy of cutting the FDA and circumventing FDA rules   Increasing the role of the nanny state is not an accomplishment.  1.Ended previous practice of having White House aides rewrite scientific and environmental rules, regulations, and reports  Good.   1.Authorized discussions with North Korea and private mission by Pres.

Jim Web to secure the release of an American held captive   Not worth the costs.  1.Making more loans available to small businesses  1.Established independent commission to make recommendations on slowing the costs of Medicare  Good.   1.Appointment of first Latina to the Supreme Court   I thought race did not matter to the left?

oba206,"I happen to think he's doing awsome, even if one disagrees, this hatred cannot possibly be based in reality.   Because everyone who disagrees with you must not be involved in reality...  As for your list of ""accomplishments"" it was rather clever of you to use a link to another forums and by doing so hiding the fact that the list is from DailyKos.  I wish I could color code stuff, but bold will represent things that are nothing special or would have most likely been done by McCain and italics will represent something that should not be the government's job or something that is not even an accomplishment.   1. Taxes are the main gripe of all those fat pasty Tea Party weirdos. Yet this very year is the least taxes Americans have paid then at any time during the Bush administration. Where were these lard asses when there was a white guy in office?   Cutting taxes is something that just about any leader would do in a recession, its the future tax hikes to cancel out the huge deficits that people are pissed about.   2.  Spending has actually been cut, and everyone conveniently ignored that Obama finally ended the f-22 program which Presidents have been trying to elimante but couldn't because they were not cool enough since Bush Sr. In fact Obama has passed 60% of cuts, much more than Bush Jr. - hence actually shrinking the size of government.   $82.69 billion dollar deficits this April, though it is nice to see the military industrial complex get a kick in the balls.   3.  Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it and held that residing government in great esteem in subsequent generations. This will be no different. If nothing else he has already assured his spot in world history as a great American President for this alone despite knee-jerk ""there's a monster in your closet"" reaction from the perpetually scared right.   I'm sure the free-riders in this country will love it and those who realize that we have no way to pay for it will hate.   4. Due to the stimulus package, the economy is improving. Here is a jobs chart link And that is actually off, we actually gained 200,000 jobs in January the most recent numbers indicate.   Keynesian economics: Fix something in the short run only to see it fail even more in the long run.   5. We are leaving Iraq, and we are doing better in Afghanistan since Obama took office now that we are actually concentrating on the terrorists responsible for 911 instead of chasing Cheyene's oil interests.

I brought it up to say that he was forced to pay more, it was mandatory.   But if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views   In the simplest of terms, an economic system is simply nothing more than a system of allocation of resources, goods, and services. Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something. As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions. Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market. Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities. Leaving them open to abuse by the rich is not what I think should happen, and that is what Libertarians would do - leave everyone to the benefits, and abuse, that others put on them through trade.  I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule   Which evidence? I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes  (the last few paragraphs) .   It's about getting government away from the banks all together.   Just like Iceland did? The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession. Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement. They simply speculated, loaned out money, told everyone it was going fine, had massive rates of leverage, and then it all fell to shit.  So no, I don't agree that deregulating the banks is a good idea, either economically, or from a humanitarian sense (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people. They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   A terrible one.   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.  But in all honesty, I haven't read around it too much, and don't have time to do so now, however, it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.",p-economy,seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes  (the last few paragraphs) .,oba254arg0

oba315,"yet it's only gotten worse, from what I've heard.   His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.   Less taxing means more debt.   But it is not spending, which actually creates debt. Taxing is unnecessary to continue spending. Government will spend as much as it wants and will tax people as much as they want. We can't just say ""increase taxes to reduce debt"" when the debt could have been avoided all together. Once again, it's a red herring.   it largely falls outside of his mandate   Then why did you bring it up in the first place?  Bill Clinton, however, signed welfare reform. This was a Federal act.   I like this part of them, but disagree with others   yet you're not specific on how their economics will hurt anyone. You've avoided pointing to specific, first saying ""welfare is necessary"" and then saying ""well, Obama has no control over welfare.""  Now, economics may not be your strong suit (it was once something i hardly considered), but if you're going to say that you don't like their economic views, you should be more specific on what is wrong with them.   Regardless, he's making an effort, and being blocked off, for no real reason   Not according to the evidence. The best you've got is that Republicans are blocking the Buffet rule, even though I already described how the Buffet rule is a ""red herring.""   You wish to completely deregulate the banks?   It's about getting government away from the banks all together. The banks, how they currently operate, could not survive without government involvement. They rely on subsidies, standardized currency, human controlled inflation and regulation to keep themselves in power. Without it they would hold little power over our wealth and currency. Currently, the banks dictate most money powers. They will continue to dictate as long as government stays involved with the affairs of the banks. This isn't about letting the large trample the small, it's about removing the power-source for this monstrosity that government created in the first place. Big government is the problem here, not lack of it.   bankers operate in their own self interest, not in that of the bank, and not in that of the country.   A bank without government would NEED to operate in the interest of the consumers or else it will attract none. Currently people feel that they need banks. While the privatization of banks seemed like a good idea during the transitional period between Centralized and non-centralized banks, what ended up happening was government assisted greedy men. You can not expect the private sector to do what it does best if government is still involved, as it always has been. The banks are protected from competitive currency because they hold all currency rights. The banks are paid by governments to continue being banks, which removes most financial liability (especially when you're large enough to ""need"" a bailout). And the banks are encouraged by leaders (government bureaucrats like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) to make poor decisions but given money to make up for those poor decisions. This isn't some magical imbecile who happens to be running a bank, this is a guy basically being given money to make poor decisions with all of our money. It was inevitable with government involvement, as Ron Paul accurately predicted.   Remember that the heads of banks who brought about the recession got hundreds of millions of dollars, that sort of behaviour would only become more common,   Not if you eliminate government involvement in the banking market.   I was simply using them as an example.   A terrible one.   I have many complaints of Republican behaviour, and I can only imagine that this budget is just more of the same.   I'm sure you do, people complain a lot. The importance is substance, though.",c-republicans,His policies on the War on Drugs are even more authoritarian than Bush's.,oba315arg0

oba328,"The inevitable demise of the economy was near under the false pretenses of the success of the housing bubble, which was created by the expansion of credit by the Federal Reserve and the Community Reinvestment Act passed by Congress.    I'm not sure how this addresses anything I just said. In fact I'm fairly certain it doesn't; The cause of the 'economic demise' was never in question, but you did just completely side-step my contention. The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.  Point being you can't blame someone for high unemployment when you personally prevented them from solving the problem, without being the world's biggest hypocrite.   To suggest that the auto industry was on the verge of collapse is a hypothetical   No it's not, it was a mathematical equation. GM had been in continuous decline for over a decade. It was 17 months from bankruptcy and a 46% chance of defaulting within the next 5 years. GM already filed for chapter 11, and was selling off most of it's assets. To deny this is the utmost absurdity.  The Math is here:   http://www.exceluser.com/tools/zscore.htm   Bankruptcy here:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization    bankruptcy is vital to capitalism because it disposes of waste.   Yeah, and that waste was millions of employees, without whom would have meant unprecedented levels of unemployment not seen since the great depression, which would have taken almost a decade or more to recover from.   GM didn't pay off the loan. They merely shifted money from the escrow account to the loan.       In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding.  ""To me, money is fungible,"" he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan.  ""It's a genuine paying back,"" White said. ""It does reduce the federal government's involvement."" Still, he said, ""it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate"" with the U.S. government.

Which is still a good sign.   All of which were created by bad government policy before.   Yeah, like the irresponsible deregulation of the housing and banking markets. When you repeal laws that prevent downright criminal business practices, this can have a detrimental effect. I don't share your faith, the private sector can fail, and history is our proof of this. If you allow multi-million dollar businesses to pilfer people of their savings and their homes, that is exactly what they will do and that is exactly what happened in 2008.",p-job,"The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President.",oba328arg0

oba342,"Taxation isnât theft, because like it or not you are part of a group of people and insofar as that group needs defense and the rule of law at a bare minimum, you have an obligation to them. A lot of the taxation is theft mentality is predicated on the notion that we (humans) are not primarily social beings. Most of what you do in the world is social activity - buying goods and services, owning property, etc... all things are allowed for and provided by a society of people, participation is a privilege and you tacitly comply with and assent to taxation merely by participating  The 'We' is the nation as a whole, the demand of the masses as expressed through voting and engaging in political discourse.   i definitely agree that prudent is open to opinion, this is where the 'We' comes in, the 'we' becomes the expression of the collective opinon  You have obviously been smoking the supply side theory insofar as you think that the middle class is allowed for by the wealthy. Tax policy and education policy is what allows for the creation of a middle class and jobs are created by the market. It is true that if the wealthy have all the money that jobs are created by them because they are the only ones who could invest, however, if they donât have all the money, jobs are created by where money is invested. Middle class people can invest just as much as the wealthy, and do when given the opportunity to when tax policy is not skewed in favor of the wealthy. Just because a lot of money is in the hands of the wealthy, doesnât mean that this is the fundamental nature of job creation, it is only the nature of job creation in an extremely stratified society. Extreme stratification also creates instability in the market because investment is based on the whim of a small number of individuals who have often, in the past, jumped ship and played with the markets toward their own personal gain (not that personal gain is a problem, it is only a problem when it is done by manipulation and with the known consequence of huge costs to other people.) This is why there are anti-trust laws and laws that prevent monopolies.   The he who serves best earns best notion is valid to a point, but national income is not a reflection of this, income and wealth is a reflection of the degree to which a few people control the means of production and maintain that order through a rationalised stratification. I am not against stratification, I just think that there needs to be an ameliorative taxation policy to prevent the various forms of desperation that are fundamental to capitalist systems.   You totally did write uber-sensitive  Some truth is subjective, some truth is objective, like this - it is objectively true that you are reading this right now. I would argue that truth that which is subjective is only opinion. subjectivity is dependent on perception, objectivity is about things that are true independent of perception even if they require a perceiver. Truth does exist independent of belief about what is true.  Afirmative action is not about putting african americans ahead of caucasion , it is about social justice, it is not fundamentally left, and is distinct from the notion of modern racism even though it relates to racial issues. modern racism is when you - believe racism is a thing of the past, - make associations about people based on their ethnicity or skin color that are not necessary links. it is racist because you are making judgements and acusations about people according to their skin color or ethnicity, this includes names and religions that are a persons cultuaral heritage.",p-economy,"Taxation isnât theft, because like it or not you are part of a group of people and insofar as that group needs defense and the rule of law at a bare minimum, you have an obligation to them.",oba342arg0

They speak against the validness of the article, and portray good arguments. Considering there is a lot of problems with the sources of information in regards to this issue, I feel it is relevant to point out misinformation where it is apparent.   Keynsian economics is not the consensus. Many believe that increased spending is never a good idea, especially under a recession. Letting the largest of corporations fail is not only supported by Right Wing economists but by even some of the Left-Wing revolutionaries (Occupy Wall Street).   I'm not even talking about how to get out of a recession, I'm talking about the very necessities of his office. In a recession, were millions become unemployed, he has to pay billions more than anyone else in the history of US presidents just in unemployment benefits, keeping the people alive. And I have no one argue that government spending should be high in a boom, such as Bush did, the second highest debt creator.   Bush had reasons, including the War and humanitarian aid for Africa and India (yeah... people forget about that part for some weird reason). I disagree with Bush's fiscal policies as well as Obama's.   The war was his choice to enter, and considering the flaky reasons for it, I do not give him any relapse on the trillions it cost. Considering the US' abysmal foreign aid (as a percentage of national income) history, its effects are miniscule on such large amounts of money.   Obama supports the Bush tax cuts. He did not try to end them in any way.    He said he would not have signed the bill if it did not include ""other extensions of relief that were also set to expire."" Among other provisions, he cited the extensions of unemployment benefits and tuition tax credits, as well as new tax incentives for businesses.  Obama acknowledged that ""there are some elements of this legislation that I don't like,"" and some that congressional Republicans and Democrats don't like. ""That's the nature of compromise, yielding on something each of us cares about to move forward on what all of us care about,"" he said. ""And right now, what all of us care about is growing the American economy and creating jobs for the American people.""   But yes, I'll concede, I wasn't aware of that. However, considering the whole Buffet tax debate (estimated to save 47 billion by 2022), I would disagree.   Even Romney wishes to use the Ryan plan, which would save AT LEAST 5 trillion dollars.   Ryan's plans were the ones that led to this recession (yes, he designed Bush's budget too). Considering the widespread criticism of his plan, I would hesitate before supporting it, yet alone attaching such massive claims to it.   It's not just about cutting spending, Ron Paul wishes to eliminate most Federal powers that keep our economy at a stranglehold.   This is what annoys me about Ron Paul. Some of his policies are fantastic, ending the war on drugs/terror, all that bullshit, but at the same time, he applies his unconventional ideals to everything, and it would just be a bad thing overall. But, that's unrelated.   How are they hurting the people it ""helps"".   Social support is supposed to help those who need it the most.

I feel like most right wing economic ideas do not promote maximal aggregate demand and thus I question the right wing economic ideas with respect to their intelligence and justifiability with respect to economic evidence and modern economic theory.   progressive taxation inspires greater consumption from the group that consumes the greatest - The Middle Class. It is the best way to accelerate economic activity. As far as i am aware, Supply side economics (i.e. trickle down economics - right wing economics) is contrary to maximal aggrigate demand because it doesnt promote consumption.   Aggregate Demand is the combination of Consumptions, Investment, Govt. Spending, and Net Trade activity. As far as i know, the wealthy invest and consume at a relatively static level as a group. The middle class invest and consume relative to their ability. Progressive taxation increases this ability for the middle class and thus, in order to maximize aggregate demand we need to policies that promote the middle class (typically left wing, socialistic policies).   To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well. I question the patriotism of the right wing because their policies tend to undermine total economic wellbeing which is fundamental to maximal economic prosperity",p-republicans,"To me it comes down to patriotism, a patriot wants the whole country to do well.

oba363,"It's more about the tyranny behind taxation.   While I don't disagree that taxes do need a justification (which I feel is there, but am currently unable to provide - only heard of Libertarianism a few months ago, I'll think of something), in terms of debt, the level of taxation is very important.   This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil.   Is it not (somewhat) balanced out by the fact that the money is (mostly) spent on the people?   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government.   You don't get what I'm saying :( My issue is that a society simply based on the value to which each person provides a good or service to another does not sound like a utopia to me. Obviously, utopia is not possible, but that's something that I like about socialistic policies, that everyone has worth, value, and deserves equality. The value or number of dollars has little do with that.   As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically).   I disagree. I feel that taxes or no, in the globalized world we live in, economies of scale has such an advantage that they are able to push people out of business with ease. Remember that countries with higher tax rates tend to have a lower wealth inequality rate (Scandanavian ones come to mind).   Free markets is very far from corporatism.   I meant simply in the way that people spend money on goods or services that they wish to possess, and people offer them. I did not mean that corporatism encouraged the free market, or is in any way good.   It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it.   The Ryan plan calls for little reform (as far as I am aware, feel free to call me out on that if I am wrong), but simply cuts people from government provision to save money.   A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I agree that this is a major problem, I have many complaints for the current government (Obama included, this started off as me defending his impact on debt), and over-regulation is one of them.   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a ""red herring.""   There is much more to the tax debate than the Buffet Rule. Your article claimed that he was unable to raise taxes on the rich in anyway, pushing millionaires' taxes to 30% is only part of it.   Way to leave out the most important part.   The banks damage was done at that point, one bank went into voluntary administration before it was taken over. So no, I don't feel that the government was the cause of the crash, the high risk, over-leveraged, under-regulated banking bubble was the cause of the Icelandic crash.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   The housing market crashed because of banks, CDO's & derivatives, pretending high risk options were completely safe, and frivolously acting bankers.  Out of interest, why do you feel that regulators have a responsibility to see these sort of things, if you are against them?   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please?   Funny how you talk about how government hurts small businesses, then defend corporations actions which do the same.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers.   An economy is nothing but a system of allocation of resources to fulfill the needs and wants of society. I trust them to say when the system would not meet needs and wants adequately. I would not trust them to suggest an alternative system, just as I would never presume to do the same, but the commentary they provide is not worthless.",p-republicans,"I have many complaints for the current government (Obama included, this started off as me defending his impact on debt), and over-regulation is one of them.",oba363arg0

OK, I don't know if this is a purposeful lie or you just don't see this. Tax rates have actually gone up for almost everyone paying taxes, but we are in a massive recession, so tax revenue is down.

Spending has actually been cut   No. Sure he cut the f-22 program, but the stimulus bill, health care, and a myriad of other programs have skyrocketed federal spending. This is just not true.

First of all, 200,000 jobs gained in January are census jobs mostly. Second, the stimulus package contained almost NO stimulus. It CANNOT stimulate the economy because it was almost entirely pork barrel spending and was ""stimulus"" in name only. That aside, we have clearly lost jobs, as unemployment has gone from 6% to 10%.

Anyway, I'm gonna skim and end, because I think I've made my point.   1.Ordered all federal agencies to undertake a study and make recommendations for ways to cut spending    Political double speak. While he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   see above.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors.   1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House   He said. But we have seen the heaviest lobbying in White House history under his regime.  Anyway, point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust. The ""budget neutral"" health care bill has now been revealed by the CBO to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit. We are spending 150% of our GDP in deficit spending (Greece is collapsing at only 119%).

While he drastically increases spending he attempts to make himself look good by ordering reviews.   1.Ordered a review of all federal operations to identify and cut wasteful spending and practices   see above.   1.Instructed all federal agencies to promote openness and transparency as much as possible   while bills like the 1 trillion dollar health care bill are done completely behind closed doors.   1.Limits on lobbyist's access to the White House   He said. But we have seen the heaviest lobbying in White House history under his regime.  Anyway, point being almost everything this man touches turns to dust. The ""budget neutral"" health care bill has now been revealed by the CBO to be a 1 trillion dollar deficit. We are spending 150% of our GDP in deficit spending (Greece is collapsing at only 119%).

When the representatives finish debating and come to some kind of concession, a bill will be proposed for legislation, voted on and the President  will then  review it, sign on or veto it for another round of debate. It would be pointless for the President to read all of the bills before they are up for legislation.   Only when a politician reaches out to the public divulging every detail of how legislation will work and can then explain in detail how any random citizen's particular situation will be affected, will they gain my respect.

oba427,"then are you saying that taxation doesn't matter?   It's more about the tyranny behind taxation. In the terrible shit-storm that government has created thus far, it is almost impossible to eliminate most taxes today. However, we should be progressing past the need for taxation all together. Create a new system dependent on proper justification for spending and taxation (if necessary).  The taxes today are irresponsible and incomprehensible by average Americans. Many people have to pay someone just so they don't accidentally miss any payments. The tax bracket is better now than it has been at times, but it is unrealistic. Taxes on Capital Gains are basically taxing the same income twice.  Taxes for subsidizing wheat and corn, and products made by wheat and corn are taxed. Most states have sales tax asking that people pay the government if they wish to buy an item. Taxes on property, saying that you can't even have shelter without paying the government.  This is not proper and it is, in a moral sense, evil. The idea that an authority figure can charge you for buying something from someone else is kind of ridiculous, yet it is currently the case.  So it's not so wise to just say ""yeah, taxes should go up because what about the debt?"" The debt is from irresponsible spending from the government. The government is now asking us to pay for their mistakes. Furnishings that don't even benefit most of us. TJ called this shit tyrannical for a reason.   Pure capitalism cares only about the number of dollars you will put towards something.   The number of dollars and the strength of that dollar depends heavily on government. Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate. People do not end their pursuit of profit just because government has made things more expensive for them. They will simply pass the expenses unto the consumer, as we have seen with the healthcare and agricultural businesses.   As there is not equality of opportunity, this is not fair, those on the bottom have less, and not only from their own actions.   As shown, historically (as I've pointed out a few times already), private endeavors succeed far more in spreading wealth across the nation than public efforts. This is because government has no concern for efficiency. While welfare and social services may be for noble reasons, they have been unsuccessful in getting people out of the slums. Allowing businesses to operate unrestricted creates growth. More goods and services are provided at a cheaper rate because the business men want to make these items cheaply. They don't want expensive items. Expensive items mean less consumers.  As well, government efforts have created the great disproportion of wealth (historically). It goes all the way back to the bourgeoisie and we see it today with the monopolies created solely by government. The largest of corporations owe most of their strength to government regulations and restrictions that have hurt small business, subsidization and contracts that has chosen winners, and ridiculous business taxes that small businesses couldn't keep up with.   Those with money rule, the corporatism we have seen recently within US politics is arguably nothing more than the merging of politics and the free market.   The ""corporatist"" legislation includes major regulations on the market. Government should not have the power to put such restrictions on individuals, yet we give it that power by claims of non-trust for the free market. Free markets is very far from corporatism.   Those who do not have money deserve protection, they need food, water, shelter, and other similar necessities.   Even if we look to a futuristic utopia where the Free Market has prevailed over tyrannical government, government's place will still be to provide basic needs (security, vouchers for food and healthcare) at a much cheaper and efficient rate. However, government currently is a bureaucratic mess and the only defense that people can have for it all is the fear of an alternative that has never done harm (in fact, 'regression' towards free markets has done wonders for the economies of the USSR and China).  Vouchers (like food stamps, or the Paul Ryan healthcare plan) are cheaper and allow the market to do what it does best, compete for customers. It's a system of welfare that is efficient and I have no problem with it. That is currently, however, not what government does.   I love the idea of people being completely free to do what they want with their own money, their own time, their own labour, but people are not free, they are forced to work, they need an income to survive.   Hardly. The expense of most food industries comes from heavy regulation and taxation. One is not allowed to sell food without going through months of expensive protocol. How can a poor person in a poor neighborhood afford to do that or keep up with all business regulations and fees? This is what impoverishes the people the most.  A neighborhood is unable to bring in resources and capital because government, basically, will not allow them.   I seem to remember you posting a link that showed that Obama is being blocked from increasing any taxes   as explained, the Buffet Rule is a ""red herring.""   The government ended sold their state bank about ten years ago I believe, outside banks came in, made loads of money for a while, everyone was happy, but they were just part of the problem, put no safeguards in place, acted recklessly, and were destroyed in the recession.   Way to leave out the most important part. When the recession was occurring, the Icelandic government PANICKED and made drastic action believing that the banks wouldn't be able to handle the downfall of the European Union's dollar (the EU had much to do with this, sir). Iceland surrendered ownership of their banks to government regulators and this is where all hell broke loose. Now, the development of the banks was already a fault of government, as government, as I explained before, should have NOTHING TO DO with the banks. No start up help, no subsidies, no regulations, no nothing. Iceland would not have been able to invest so much power into three banks if they had completely avoided that market. As I've stated, it is better to either have a Centralized bank or no government involvement with banks at all. I'd choose the latter, especially today, because of the great catastrophe government has created in the banking and currency systems.   Now the prime minister is being put onto trial for gross negligence (the only head of state to be formally punished as part of the recession). It's worth remembering that the banks that did this were new to the country (all but one), they were not used to government involvement   If government had stayed out of it all along, none of this would have been an issue. Iceland would have been one of the countries to avoid the mess that the EU and US created with their meddling in the private sector.   (banks in many countries now refuse to lend to anyone those who need it, because they see it as 'high risk'. I understand taking a harsher tone on lending, but blocking off everyone, without considering them, is bad for people.   The regulators of the Fed had a similar position as yours, and this is why the housing market crashed.   They now only lend to businesses with capital to pay them back for sure).   With a completely private sector, why would this be a problem if individuals decide to do business with whomever they please? Is it government's role to build up such monstrous corporations only to try and tame them and make them take care of us poor folk who need a nanny state? I find it quite shaky when we say ""hey Frankenstein, make us one of them monsters to push us around.""   I'm sorry I trust bishops to stand up for the poor, it's not like they spend their life following a doctrine that tells them to do exactly that.   And I don't trust them as economic advisers. For good reason, it's not very good to give the religious a voice in politics. But that's just my opinion.   it's not hard to find criticisms from other people in a better position to judge it than me.   Sure, but saying that still doesn't make a difference in what we're talking about.",c-economy,"Higher inflation rates and higher tax rates makes business more desperate.

He's doing a really good job especially considering what he was left with.   It is weird to believe in constitutional govt. If you think they're weird, give us reasons, or your argument is not credible and you look like a bigot (someone who makes decisions without facts).   And exactly what part of the constitution has Obama not followed? That is why they are weird, they live under a number of delusions, that the government has been acting unconstitutionally only one of many. Here are some of the other tea party delusions:  1. Obama was not born here  2. Obama is taking your guns when in fact he's relaxed gun laws.  3. Obama has raised their taxes, when in fact everyone paid less taxes last year.  4. Only poor black people who want free stuff voted for him even though he won by one of the largest majorities in history  I'm sure there are more but I try not to talk to the village idiots.  Anyway, yes, on average every one really did pay less taxes. I realize that ruins many of those potato chip stuffed asses reason for leaving their recliner and making a colorful sign, but it is the truth.  Further, half the idiot tea party crying about ""Gov'ment tooks my money! WAH!"" Actually benefit from one government program or another, and would be crying even harder if the government took away their Medicare or social security.  2. No, spending really has been cut. The stimulus was passed under Bush, and under Obama most of the money has been repaid. It's yet another silly tea bagger delusion, this idea that only Obama passed the stimulus, and that the stimulus isn't the only thing that saved us from another great depression. Every expert says without it we would be living in Hoover tents right now. Anyway,   part of the problem I see, is that people like yourself when I say ""spending has been cut"" you are comparing spending now, to spending in magical fairy land, while I on the other hand am dealing with reality, and the spending during the Bush years.  3. Uh, no.  Every  country that has a similar plan, and usually an even more liberal plan than what was passed here, spends less per capita on healthcare. That means they have more money. That means they are less likely to have financial meltdowns due to healthcare. Again, you do not argue in reality. Look at any chart of healthcare spending and you will see the US spent nearly twice as much as any country before this was passed.  4. Oh my god, are you literally retarded? I mean I had my suspicions when I saw your name, looks like a gay dating site title, but that aside I didn't really think you were literally retarded until I saw your number 4 point there.   Bush was handed the best economy in the history of the US due to Clinton's policies. This massive surplus was literally squandered by that monkey Bush in about 3 years. Due to what you call ""stimulus"" which is really just tax cuts for people who don't need them and won't put the money back into the economy and insane deregulation that started with Reagan, we went from the greatest US economy in history to the second worst in US history.  It is truly an accomplishment in itself, how one crappy president with daddy issues can bring an entire economy to it's knees so quickly. Now we have an intelligent person in office, and for the first time in about 6 years each month is showing less job losses than the last, and in some instances actual job gains,  and still you preach Bush era economic strategy. It is truly mind boggling how one can be so completely clueless.  Honestly I'm bored of you now.  I will add though to your ""bigot"" comment. You do realize that if Obama were not black this fake corporate run grass roots tea bagger bs would not happen. Sure some are just clueless idiots who live in a Faux Noise media alternate Universe and have no idea how backwards their view of what is going on is, but most are pissed because ""real America"" as they put it, in there view does not include black people. Disliking people because of their opinions is far different than comparing a democratically elected president to Hitler and insisting he was not born here all because of the color of his skin.  And I don't want to hear the old line ""no that's not it uh, uh, it's his policies.""  Bullshit. Where was the tea party in the Clinton years? Where was the tea party when Bush with the help of that troll Cheyenne destroyed the strongest economy in the world? Nowhere, because Clinton and Bush are white.
